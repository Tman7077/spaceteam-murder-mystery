## Alex Blackhole: Interstellar Captain

*"The human body is a puzzle—every joint, every bone, every nerve has its place."*

Alex has a sharp mind and a sharper focus, known for his uncanny ability to identify and alleviate physical discomfort. He’s always ready to crack a joke—or a spine—but beneath his calm demeanor lies a meticulous curiosity. His fascination with anatomy borders on the obsessive, making his expertise both reassuring and, perhaps, unsettling. On the spaceship, his steady hands and precise knowledge are invaluable, but in the quiet vastness of space, precision can be a double-edged sword.

### DEATH

Alex was conducting a routine inspection of the ship’s navigation systems to investigate minor anomalies. While examining the console, a muffled noise echoed, and the lights flickered—but the crew passed it off as turbulence. Just now, he failed to arrive at the evening check-in, so we searched and found him slumped near the navigation console. A faint burn mark on his palm suggests an electrical discharge, but the scene feels too deliberate to be a simple accident.

### CLUES & HINTS

- A utility knife with a faint trace of dried blood, often carried by Alex. 
- A charcoal pencil broken in half, something Cade was seen borrowing earlier. 
- A notebook with partially erased notes about system diagnostics, in Colter's handwriting. 
- A stray screwdriver left near the console, matching Courtney's usual tools.
- 
- A white wristband that matches Jacie's sterile suit. 
- A mug of hot cocoa sitting on the console, the same mug Olsen often drinks out of. 
- A cryptic note tucked into the console’s edge, containing coding symbols Tyler would recognize. 

### INTERVIEW RESPONSES

#### Cade:

> Cade borrows my watch sometimes when he’s batting, just to keep track of how many calories he’s burning. He asked for it after I stopped my run this morning.

> Hey, sometimes he takes my watch to track his stuff when he needs to blow off some steam. I’m sure that’s all it was. Stinks that it’s cracked, though.

#### Colter:

> Colter recently tore one of his gloves, so he asked to borrow mine. I gave it to him a few days ago, and that’s the last I saw it. It looks like he just made a mistake and burned it, but I wasn’t involved at all.

> So, he had my glove? He probably burnt one of his and just used mine so he wasn’t bare-handing the chemicals. You know how his stuff gets a little sketchy sometimes.

#### Courtney:

> Yep, that’s my pen. Maybe hers ran out of ink, I’m really not sure. It’s just a pen, though.

> Why would it be my pen? She’s got the same one, I’m sure it’s hers. She was drawing, so having a pen makes a lot of sense...

#### Ethan:

> 

> 

#### Jacie:

> I was there yesterday morning helping her prune some of the plants, and left the shears with her when I had to go. She’s had them since.

> Jacie uses those too! I might do most of the pruning, but she often does some of the smaller fine trimming with them so she doesn’t have to make me do it. She’s nice like that.

#### Olsen:

> Yeah, I was just in here! Of course the cocoa is still warm. Olsen and I were talking, but I got a ping and had to go check on the navigation quickly. It took longer than expected, so something must have happened while I was gone.

> I’m not the only one who drinks out of that mug. Someone could easily have planted it there to try to frame me. I was in the nav center.

#### Tyler:

> Yeah! Tyler and I have been passing that back and forth for the last few days. We’ve had to avoid a few asteroid fields and planetary gravity fields so we have to adjust navigation and Tyler has been helping with the tech side. So yeah, he had my notebook, but it was innocent!

> A notebook that we share? Of course he had it. There’s nothing interesting about that.

### ACCUSATION RESPONSES

#### Cade:

> This man is my roommate, my close friend, my confidant, and a guy that I admire. I would never hurt him. You can’t pin this on me. Please.

> Fine, I did it. I walked in while he was batting and asked to join. He was showing me what he always does to hit it well every time, and I tried it. He was walking up to show me one more thing, but I didn’t realize, and I swung back. He held up his arm to block the blow, but I hit him hard enough that it didn’t make a difference. He was on the floor in a second, but I thought he was just knocked out. I went to get some ice and find meds, and that’s when everyone started getting together. I wanted to help, but couldn’t believe what had just happened, so I lied earlier. It was my fault.

#### Colter:

> Dude, I did not hurt Colter! I have zero problems with him using my gloves—I’d want him to be safe, even if it meant giving up a silly pair of gloves. I promise I didn’t do anything to him. Something else happened.

> Okay, fine. He took my gloves again, after ruining who knows how many pairs of his own with his stupid chemical reactions, and I went after him. I tried to grab the gloves from him, and ended up knocking over a vial of something. It smelled awful, so I ran straight out of the room—I guess it wasn’t just an awful smell, and he never got up from it. It was an accident. The gloves aren’t that big of a deal, and now he’s dead because of me.

#### Courtney:

> You really think I could kill Courtney? No way, guys. I really didn’t do it. She went out to stargaze and I went to bed early, so I could get up for my morning run tomorrow.

> You know what, it was me. I came out to sit with her, and she closed her book as soon as I walked in. She wouldn’t tell me what she was hiding, so I took the book from her. I opened it and there were all these lovely notes about everyone in the group—except me. She’s out there alone, writing all these nice things about everyone except me, with my pen, and hiding it from me? I got angry, punched her in the gut, tore the pages out, and walked away. A stupid punch shouldn’t have killed her, though, unless I really hit the wrong thing hard. Look, I’m sorry.

#### Jacie:

> Hey, hey, hey. I wanted to get up early this morning to go on a long run, so I actually went to bed last night. I wasn’t there, I promise. I didn’t hurt Jacie.

> You know what, you’re right. I do have to come clean. Jacie has been talking trash about everyone behind their backs, and I’m tired of it. She grew a pineapple just to sneak into Courtney’s food, she spends long hours in the stupid garden growing plants and seemingly plotting to make our lives harder. I went in with the shears to prune and just stabbed her, cleaned them, and left. I shouldn’t have done it, I was just angry and we’re all stuck here. I’m sorry, everyone.

#### Ethan:

> 

> 

#### Olsen:

> I told you, I was in the navigation room! I’m pretty sure you guys want us to stay on course. I did not kill Olsen, whether or not you believe me. Please do, though, I love you guys.

> Fine. I was over Olsen always being... everywhere. I feel like no one ever really gets alone time because he’s either walking around talking to people or breathing down our necks. I know he had good intentions, but man. Sometimes I just wished he would stop talking, a lot. I sat down while he was doing the puzzle with some hot cocoa, but my mind was racing and I forgot about it. I offered to pop his back and just cracked a little extra, then went to the nav room to think. I can’t believe I killed him, but it’s too late to go back now.

#### Tyler:

> I really didn’t mess with Tyler. I needed his help—we all did. At this point, I just hope all his work helps us to get there in one piece.

> You’re right. I did kill Tyler. I wanted to help with the tech side of navigation rather than just all the math calculations I usually do, so I asked Tyler to show me the ropes. He was extremely defensive, saying he didn’t want help because he was afraid I would mess things up and cause a problem.
