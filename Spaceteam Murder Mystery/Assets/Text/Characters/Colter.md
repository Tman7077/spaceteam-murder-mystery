# Colter Helix: Shooting Star

*"The higher you climb, the farther you can see."*

`Facing: Left` `3072, 964, 1`

Colter’s towering frame and projecting confidence make him a natural presence in any room—or ship. His resourcefulness and knack for problem-solving are matched only by his dry wit. He’s a curious blend of studious and spontaneous, often experimenting with chemicals or exploring new ideas for the sheer thrill of it. Colter’s laid-back nature draws people in, but his occasional bursts of loud enthusiasm remind everyone that there’s always more to him than meets the eye.

## DEATH

### Pre-Death Blurb

Colter spends the evenings engrossed in experiments within the laboratory, his natural curiosity leading him to tinker with complex chemical compounds. This morning, however, he was absent at breakfast. We found him slumped over his workstation, a chemical spill spreading across the counter. The acrid smell in the air suggests toxic fumes, but the arrangement of equipment hints at a more calculated setup. Was Colter’s intellect the target, or his downfall?

### Post-Death Blurb

Colter was always thinking ahead: experimenting, solving, creating. Now his brilliance has been snuffed out. We owe it to him to find the truth and make sure no more light is lost in the dark.

## INTERVIEW RESPONSES

### [Alex](Alex.md#death):

> I gave him some of my notes earlier because he asked me to get some info from Tyler about the navigation systems. I’m not sure why part of it is erased, though.

> I was wondering where those were. I was just trying to learn from Tyler, and it looks like Alex took the notes for something—I don’t know what for.

### [Cade](Cade.md#death):

> I was hanging out with Cade this morning while he was setting up the cage, and I was messing around with some chemicals for a reaction I was planning earlier. I dropped a little on the floor, and left immediately to control it before I made more of a mess. Sorry I burned the turf, but I didn’t hurt Cade.

> I was working with some chemicals and they burned the turf, okay? I didn’t think it was that big of a deal, but that’s got nothing to do with a literal dead man on the floor.

### [Courtney](Courtney.md#death):

> Courtney’s been hanging out in my lab with me a little more recently, and it’s totally possible a little of something I was working on spilled on her book. Pretty innocent, if you ask me.

> Honestly, my experiments get a little messy sometimes and they can get places that I don’t even understand. I couldn’t tell you what that was from if I wanted to.

### [Ethan](Ethan.md#death):

> I was probably playing my banjo in the kitchen earlier, and just left that music there. I've been trying to write a song in some of my free time, and sometimes thoughts come and it's easier to scribble them down on whatever sheet of paper I've got, hence the torn lab notebook page.

> Guys. It's a sheet of paper. Doot doot. Back off.

### [Jacie](Jacie.md#death):

> I knew I lost a glove somewhere! I can’t remember how it got into Jacie’s garden, but I promise that doesn’t mean I hurt her.

> So my glove was in a pile of dirt. I see how that’s sus, but I honestly leave them places I don’t even remember, so it was just an accident. I didn’t kill Jacie.

### [Olsen](Olsen.md#death):

> I brought Olsen his mug of, well, Olsen earlier. I must have had some random chemical on my hands, though; it’s kind of crazy that my handprint is still there from hours ago.

> You’re gonna look at a faint handprint on a mug and say it’s me? That’s crazy. My hands are big but not that different from anyone else’s! You can’t just pin this on me because I have hands—you all do too!

### [Tyler](Tyler.md#death):

> Ha! I wondered where that went. I’m not sure how it ended up with Tyler or what he might have been doing with it. It’s just some chemical formulas, and they probably don’t mean anything to him.

> So he found one of my random notes. I have no idea what he was up to, and I didn’t even know he could understand it! That doesn’t mean I somehow killed him over it.

## ACCUSATION RESPONSES

### [Alex](Alex.md#death):

> Guys! Seriously! I didn’t hurt Alex. He just needed my notes, that’s all! Please, don’t blame me; I just want to figure this out like all of you do.

> Okay, okay. Alex has been messing with my notes recently, and I really don’t know why. I’ve approached him about it and he’s denied it again and again. I caught him erasing them in the nav room today, and I lost it. I just wanted to throw off his plans, and mess with him like he has been messing with me, but when I hit the console, it sparked and he was out. I couldn’t wake him up. I never wanted to hurt him.

### [Cade](Cade.md#death):

> Guys, the chemical thing was an accident, and it was many hours ago. I think with how many people were in and out of that room today, you would have noticed if Cade was dead on the floor! I didn’t do anything to him.

> Okay, okay. Cade’s incessant batting at all hours was getting on my nerves. I took some chemicals into the rec room with me, and asked Cade to help me out. I lied, and it was actually a brew meant to make him feel sick so I’d have some peace and quiet for a while. I didn’t mean for it to be this strong. He quickly got disoriented and fell, breaking the bat and probably his ribs. I’m so sorry. I just wanted a break from the bat noises all day.

### [Courtney](Courtney.md#death):

> Sometimes I make a mess and can’t always clean it up, but that could have been from today or from a week ago! It’s just a stain on a paper, it doesn’t mean I killed Courtney. I had no reason to!

> The stained paper really didn’t have anything to do with it, but I do have to come clean. Courtney has been really distant recently, not talking to us or hanging out as much. Of course, I respect her space, but I also wanted her to come back! I went in to talk to her, and she started telling me about how she was having a hard time living with all of us on the spaceship, so she had to start writing down nice things about us to force herself to believe them. She told me about the things I do that annoy her and I just got mad. I shoved her to the ground and she smacked her head. I feel terrible, but she didn’t want to be here anyways, so maybe it’s good for all of us.

### [Ethan](Ethan.md#death):

> I did not do it! Maybe Ethan and I didn't always get along, but no one is perfect! I don't get why you think that just because I left some of my thoughts on a paper in the kitchen, I killed Ethan. That's insane. I didn't do anything.

> I shouldn't have done it. Ethan kind of just showed up one day, and everyone loved him. He's fun, he's exciting, and he one-ups me all the time. I sat down to re-string my banjo as he was whipping up some gourmet meal to make everyone swoon again, and just let the anger take over. I took the string around his neck and he was out quickly. It's kind of hard to hide a body in this place, so I just left him and hoped you wouldn't figure out it was me.

### [Jacie](Jacie.md#death):

> Guys, we all know I make messes sometimes. I spill chemicals during turbulence, I leave my stains places I don’t even realize. I promise that however my glove got there was completely innocent, and I didn’t do anything to Jacie.

> Right! Right. It was me. Some of the stuff she was growing for us tasted awful and she just kept making us eat them. I thought she would already be in bed, so I whipped up a chemical that would make the plants slowly die and snuck into her garden. To my surprise, she was sitting there on the ground, tending to the pineapple plants. She caught me red handed, so I just threw the brew at her and the plant. It burned her and singed the pineapple leaf into her hand. I tried to cover it all up, but I knew you would figure me out. It was a stupid mistake in a moment of fear.

### [Olsen](Olsen.md#death):

> All from a handprint, huh? You guys are so lame. I didn’t do it. Really.

> Honestly, maybe it was me! There’s no mistaking that that’s my handprint. Plus, I was catalyzing a couple reactions this morning, and that could easily have caused my print to stay on the mug for a while. I guess I didn’t wash my hands thoroughly enough, and I left some residue on the mug. He probably drank out of the mug and something deadly got into his system. I never meant to hurt him.

### [Tyler](Tyler.md#death):

> I really don’t know what Tyler was up to, or how he died. It looks weird that some of my notes were there, but I promise it doesn’t mean anything!

> Stop! Just let me speak. I have been developing a new chemical and I knew Tyler was on to me. The goal was to extend our lifespan with some injections, and Tyler wasn’t thrilled with the idea. He took some of my notes and I caught him in the control room trying to analyze the formula. I didn’t want him to expose me so I bashed his head into the table. It shot an error onto the screen so I hoped it would look accidental. Obviously I did something terrible, so I felt like I had to tell you. It’s fine, I deserve whatever you guys are going to do to me.
