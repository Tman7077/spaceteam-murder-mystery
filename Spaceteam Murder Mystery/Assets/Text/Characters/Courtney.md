# Courtney Lunaris: Galaxy of Wonder

*"Space is a blank canvas, and I can’t wait to fill it."*

`Facing: Left`

Courtney’s artistic soul finds inspiration in the boundless expanse of the cosmos. She’s the dreamer of the group, always capturing moments through her sketches or finding beauty in the cold, dark void. Her playful side, epitomized by her beloved shark onesie, masks a sharp intelligence and quiet resilience. In the vacuum of space, creativity is survival, and Courtney's ability to see what others don’t might be the key to unlocking more than just inspiration.

## DEATH

### Pre-Death Blurb

Courtney often retreats to the observation deck to find inspiration among the stars. On this particular night, she brought her notepad, eager to capture the cosmic beauty outside. When she failed to return when we were heading to bed, we discovered her lifeless body. Her notepad lies open to a half-finished drawing, but she is positioned facing away from the window—strange.

### Post-Death Blurb

Courtney turned the cold emptiness of space into something beautiful. Her creativity and kindness meant something. We have to hold onto that meaning now, and make sure we don’t lose anyone else.

## INTERVIEW RESPONSES

### [Alex](Alex.md#death):

> That is mine, but it’s there for good reason! He said there was some problem he needed to fix with the console, so he asked to borrow my screwdriver. I gave it to him, and that’s all I know.

> Yeah, it’s mine, but he wanted it to fix something with the console. I didn’t want to mess with the tech, so I just gave it to him. What if something happened, and he hit a wrong wire, and shocked himself? Do you really think I would hurt him?

### [Cade](Cade.md#death):

> I was working in the engine room earlier. I came in and talked to Cade for a sec, and must have left a smudge behind.

> When I get dirty working in the engine room, I get pretty dirty. Sometimes that means I leave a little mess behind sometimes. I haven’t been in there since this morning, though, so it couldn’t have been me.

### [Colter](Colter.md#death):

> I honestly don’t keep track of that thing. We keep all of our doors unlocked anyways, so I never think to bring it with me. I’m not sure how it got there.

> Why would I know what Colter was doing with my keycard? I never bring it with me anyways; all of our doors are just unlocked all the time.

### [Ethan](Ethan.md#death):

> I'm not sure why a burned pan means me, but it definitely wasn't.

> Dude what are you talking about? Guess what—stoves get hot. You know where a pan goes? On a stove. Maybe something flared up and burned the pan. It wasn't me.

### [Jacie](Jacie.md#death):

> I actually didn’t even realize I wasn’t wearing that on my shoulder. It must have come off the last time I was helping her in the garden. I know it looks suspicious, but it really doesn’t mean anything.

> That darn thing has really come loose recently. Just because it was in the room doesn’t mean I stabbed her with it or anything, it was just a mistake.

### [Olsen](Olsen.md#death):

> Okay, I know there’s not a lot that’s bright blue and soft on this ship, so it most likely is from my onesie. I don’t know how it got there though! That doesn’t make me sound very good, but I really didn’t want to hurt Olsen.

> Bro, a onesie is not worth killing someone for! You have to see that I know that. Maybe it is mine, maybe it’s something else entirely. But you can’t blame me just because of a dumb tuft of whatever it is.

### [Tyler](Tyler.md#death):

> I loved that pencil. I don’t know why he had it or why he would have broken it, but that doesn’t mean I killed him.

> Dude that’s so lame. I loved that pencil. I can’t believe he would have broken it, that’s terrible. But I didn’t kill him for it—it’s just a pencil, even if it was my favorite one.

## ACCUSATION RESPONSES

### [Alex](Alex.md#death):

> Bro! You seriously think I would kill Alex? No way! I actually can’t believe you guys. You’re wrong, and accusing me won’t help anything! Goodness.

> Look, I’m sorry. He asked for some help with the nav console, and I brought the screwdriver to work on it. I hit something wrong, it sparked, and he was gone. I left the screwdriver behind to make it look like an accident, because I freaked out and didn’t know what else to do. I never wanted to hurt him, just to help him.

### [Cade](Cade.md#death):

> Bro, stop coming at me. I left a little oil behind, but that’s just part of working on the messy things! Be grateful, too, we kinda need those guys to keep flying in the right direction. I didn’t do anything to Cade.

> Jeez, guys, sorry. I brought a little grime with me when I came in, and he got mad about my mess. I tossed the bat at him, and he obviously wasn’t a fan, so he turned around to come at me, and tripped over the bat. He fell right on it, cracking it in half. He was rolling around groaning, but I was mad so I just closed the door and left. I didn’t realize he got hurt that bad, or I would have turned around and tried to help.

### [Colter](Colter.md#death):

> Why would I do anything to Colter? I’ve got no idea what he was doing with my card, but I didn’t even realize he had it. I did not kill him. You’ve got the wrong person.

> Hey, okay, okay. I walked in to see what he was up to, and he was using my own personal keycard as a bench scraper—I mean, what the heck? I grabbed it from him, and on my way out I poured a vial of something into a different beaker just to mess up his experiment. Then I left. Maybe it reacted wrong, maybe it blew up, or maybe he made a mistake later that afternoon and accidentally killed himself! I honestly don’t know what happened, but I hate to think it was my fault, just because I was salty about a stupid plastic card.

### [Ethan](Ethan.md#death):

> Hey, even if for some reason someone burned his pan with my blowtorch—which still doesn't make sense to me—I'm not the one who killed Ethan. I hate to blame someone else, but it has to be one of you.

> Honestly, I can't explain it. I have no defense. I've got a lot of kitchen gadgets, and Ethan wanted to use one after another, all afternoon. I was working on one of my projects, so when he asked me to come in again, I mindlessly brought the blow torch. Interrupting me for what felt like the tenth time had me on edge, so when his only question was if he could use my freaking salt, I threatened him with the torch. He help up the pan in defense and I lit it up. I slammed the torch into the pan and it hit him right in the throat. A hot pan in the perfect spot must have hurt, but he wasn't dead when I left, just on the ground hurting. I didn't mean to kill him... if I even did.

### [Jacie](Jacie.md#death):

> I loved Jacie! She was so sweet and always helped out. I didn’t hurt her, guys. My medallion just came off, and I really don’t know what was up with the pineapple leaf. It’s just a plant like everything else in that room.

> Alright! I killed her. She kept sneaking more and more pineapple into every dish she made, even if it was just into my serving! I can’t stand the stuff, and you all know that. I went in to help, and just took off my medallion and stabbed her with it. It was small enough that I knew you wouldn’t catch it. I was horrified at what I had just done, so I got up and left, leaving it right on the ground. Garbage mistake. I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have overreacted, but I doubly shouldn’t have outed myself.

### [Olsen](Olsen.md#death):

> Guys! Like I said, it’s probably a piece of my onesie, but who cares? I’d rather have a little bald spot or hole than a dead friend. I would not kill Olsen over something so small.

> Okay, whatever. I was walking into the room, and Olsen scooted his chair back right into me. He tore a hole right in the side of my beautiful onesie and I honestly just lost it. He said sorry, but by the way he was laughing it sure didn’t feel genuine. I pushed the chair right back under the table with him still standing in front of it, and it just bent him the wrong way and he fell to the ground just as fast as he fell off the couch last fall. I just assumed he was hurting, and I sure wasn’t in the mood to help, so I walked out and went to patch a hole in the onesie. It looks so sad now.

### [Tyler](Tyler.md#death):

> I told you, it was just a pencil! I don’t know why it was there or if he was the one that broke it, but I would never kill someone just for a stupid pencil. I loved it, but not that much. Now stop blaming me for it!

> Fine! Stupid Tyler took my pencil, hid it from me, taunted me that he had it, and wouldn’t give it back. I snuck into the control room when I knew he was there, and it was right there on the table. I walked up behind him silently and smashed his head into the table so I could grab the pencil and run. That’s exactly what I did, but the impact snapped the pencil. It was too late, so I just had to run before he came to and realized what happened.. I had no idea he died until you all grabbed me this morning. I feel terrible. I’m so sorry. It’s just a dumb pencil.
