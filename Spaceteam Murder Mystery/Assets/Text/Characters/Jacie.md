# Jacie Starwalker: Astral Angel

*"Life is a homestead; it thrives when we care for it together."*

`Facing: Right` `1201, 1031, 5`

Jacie’s nurturing disposition makes her the group’s caretaker. Whether tending to plants, calming animals, or soothing tensions, she thrives on bringing life to others. On the spaceship, her green thumb extends to the small garden she’s cultivated—an oasis of calm in the sterile environment. Her desire to please often leaves her overlooked, but even the softest voices carry weight in the silence of space.

## DEATH

### Pre-Death Blurb

Jacie spent her evening tending to the geoponics bay, as she often does, ensuring the plants are thriving. She spoke frequently about the garden’s importance to the mission, but she always came to bed when she was done, so her absence this morning was alarming. We found her in the bay, face down in a pile of dirt. Such a large pile of dirt outside of the planters was a mess Jacie would never make, so how—and why—did this happen?

### Post-Death Blurb

Jacie gave life to every corner of this ship, from plants, to friendships, to hope. Her kindness made this place feel human. Now we must honor her memory by keeping that humanity, and the rest of us, alive.

## INTERVIEW RESPONSES

### [Alex](Alex.md#death):

> I was wondering where that was! I thought I lost it in the dirt somewhere, and I was going to go digging for it tomorrow. I have no idea why Alex had it.

> I have no idea why Alex had my wristband. I always wear it when I’m working in the bay, but he could have taken it any other time.

### [Cade](Cade.md#death):

> Honestly, I got done with a long morning of tending to the garden, and I just went to decompress a little in the rec room with Cade. I took off my shoes and dumped some of the dirt out, and just didn’t feel like cleaning it up.

> I was a little frustrated with the plants this morning, so when I went to talk to Cade, I didn’t even realize I hadn’t cleaned myself up. I was all dirty and brought that into the room with me. Only after I left did I realize I was a mess, so I went to shower. That’s the last time I was with him, a couple hours ago.

### [Colter](Colter.md#death):

> I’m not exactly sure what he was up to, but honestly I think he might have been trying to make clones. He asked me for some hair, which I thought was crazy, but I figured there was no way he would make any progress, so I just gave him some and went on my way. That’s all I know.

> I honestly think he was going a little crazy, working on clones or something. He wanted my hair, which is insane, but he said he had some of Alex’s and Courtney’s already, plus I didn’t think it would actually go anywhere, so I gave him a few and walked away. I can’t believe he’s dead.

### [Courtney](Courtney.md#death):

> It’s just a plant, right? One leaf isn’t that big of a deal, and I don’t know why she had it.

> So, a leaf in her book? She could have yanked it off a plant whenever, that says nothing about my involvement. I wasn’t there.

### [Ethan](Ethan.md#death):

> Ethan was always so focused in the kitchen. I just stopped by to grab some herbs for him, but I didn’t stick around. I hope whatever happened wasn’t because of something I did.

> Look, I brought him some fresh basil, that’s it! I wasn’t even near the stove when things went wrong. Why is everyone looking at me like I had something to do with it?

### [Olsen](Olsen.md#death):

> I try not to make messes, guys. Sorry I tracked some dirt in, but that could have been from early this morning or from two hours ago. I’ve got no idea. I didn’t do anything to Olsen.

> So I can’t walk around? When I’m all up in the dirt, I get a little messy! That doesn’t mean I killed Olsen, so get off my back.

### [Tyler](Tyler.md#death):

> A little pineapple juice? Just because I’m growing a pineapple does not mean that a little juice makes it my fault. I wasn’t with him last night.

> Anyone could have poured some juice on the console! I’m sure that would have been dangerous, and I’m not that risky. I wasn’t there, guys. Leave me alone about it.

## ACCUSATION RESPONSES

### [Alex](Alex.md#death):

> I have no reason to hurt Alex! I really don’t know why Alex had my band, but that doesn’t mean I’m mad about it! It’s just a fancy bracelet.

> You’re right, I’m sorry. I walked in to check on his navigation progress, and he was doing something with my band. It’s pretty finicky and I need it to stay safe from some of the plants, so I didn’t want him to mess with it. I grabbed it, but didn’t realize it was hooked up to the computer. I pulled it too fast and it broke the cable. It made a huge spark, and burned him. He clutched his hand, and then stopped moving. I didn’t know what to do, so I put the band back and ran. I’m sorry.

### [Cade](Cade.md#death):

> This man is literally my boyfriend. Why would I kill him? I did not!

> I never meant to hurt him. Working with the plants this morning messed me up a little, and I was sneezing a lot. When I walked into the rec room to talk to Cade, I sneezed before I even said hello, and it startled him. He turned around, but the pitching machine was still on. A ball came flying and hit him right in the head, and he fell onto the bat. I sat with him for a while and cried, because I knew he wasn’t getting back up. He was the best of us, I can’t believe he’s gone. And it’s all my fault.

### [Colter](Colter.md#death):

> Hey, I might not want two of me walking around, but that does not mean I killed Colter to stop him. I left him alone after that whole encounter because I thought it was weird, and I hadn’t seen him since. I didn’t do anything.

> Okay, but do you want two of you on this spaceship? I don’t! He stopped me as I was walking away and asked me for my hair. Do you know how weird that is? When I said it was crazy, he just reached out and plucked a few from my head. I pushed him away and ran, and I heard a crash as I was getting out the door. Something must have spilled and caused something terrible to happen. Too bad he didn’t clone himself first; then there would still be one of him.

### [Courtney](Courtney.md#death):

> Sometimes Courtney would come in and help me with the plants. She had every reason to have a little piece of the vine, as odd as it may be. It’s totally not a problem, so I had no reason to be upset at her! You have to believe me. I loved her, I didn’t kill her.

> Maybe, I did kill her. Maybe, for the last few weeks, she’s come in to help me with the plants, but instead cuts pieces off and takes them to wherever she takes them. I don’t know why she’s been killing my poor plants, the ones that are literally providing us food throughout this journey, but it got on my nerves. I walked in and she had a piece in her hands! She looked like she was just admiring her mischief and I got angry. I kicked her, and she fell over and knocked her head into the ground. Maybe, she got what she deserved, if she was going to kill the plants that are keeping us alive.

### [Ethan](Ethan.md#death):

> I would never hurt Ethan! He was always so grateful for the garden, and I loved helping him out. There’s no way I’d do anything to mess up his cooking, let alone mess him up permanently.

> Fine, maybe I should have paid more attention. I handed him the wrong jar—thought it was basil, but it was something else. I'm sure he tried some and it looks like it attacked him and he stopped breathing. The mark on his neck was probably from holding his neck. He trusted me, and I messed up. I didn’t mean for it to go so wrong, but I can’t take it back now.

### [Olsen](Olsen.md#death):

> So you think I’ll try not to make messes with a little dirt, but you expect me to make a mess with a literal dead person? That’s absurd. It wasn’t me, guys.

> You’re right. I did it. Olsen came running into the garden and told me something was wrong and I needed to come right away. Of course, I  got up and ran with him, but the huge problem? He was missing a piece of the puzzle. He had me so worried that something terrible was happening, but it was just a puzzle. I was angry so I shoved the puzzle onto the floor, but he got really mad at that and came towards me. I still had my trowel so I hit him in the head with it and he just dropped. I didn’t even think about the footprints I was leaving behind. It didn’t have to end this way.

### [Tyler](Tyler.md#death):

> Guys I really don’t know what’s up with the pineapple juice. I didn’t kill Tyler and I wish you believed me. I grow these plants to help us all, I don’t want to hurt anyone.

> You know what, fine. Maybe I did kill him. Cade kept staying up with Tyler playing games until super late, which meant he never wanted to wake up in the mornings when I was ready to start the day. I knew he’d be up again last night, so I brought in a cup of pineapple juice and “accidentally” spilled it on his control console just to mess things up for him. Something about the juice made it a much bigger mess than I thought it would be, though. It shocked Tyler and the console started smoking and saying “error” on the screen. I didn’t mean for it to completely wreck his computer or kill him, I was just angry and trying to mess him up.
