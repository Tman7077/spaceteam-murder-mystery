# Ethan Aurora: *Cosmic Champion*

*"Passion powers progress—why hold back?"*

Ethan brings an unmatched energy to the Ardent Dawn. Always in motion, he balances athleticism with practical skills, navigating each day with a mix of competitive spirit and flair. Whether he's challenging someone to a friendly contest or stirring up a gourmet meal with casual ease, Ethan fills any room with momentum. His confidence and charisma make him easy to trust—perhaps too easy. In the closed environment of deep space, even the brightest presence can cast a long shadow.

## DEATH

Ethan spent the afternoon prepping dinner in the galley, upbeat as always, joking and tossing around kitchen banter while throwing pizza dough with the finesse of his frisbee throws. As the evening approached and the crew gathered for the meal, Ethan never appeared. Eventually, someone went to check, and found him collapsed behind the food prep station, apron still tied, the meal half-cooked. Though the scene appeared natural at first, a thin red mark around his neck suggested otherwise. The liveliness that had filled every corner of the ship now echoes as silence.
