# Ethan Aurora: *Cosmic Champion*

*"Passion powers progress—why hold back?"*

`Facing: Left` `1986, 987, 6`

Ethan brings an unmatched energy to the Ardent Dawn. Always in motion, he balances athleticism with practical skills, navigating each day with a mix of competitive spirit and flair. Whether he's challenging someone to a friendly contest or stirring up a gourmet meal with casual ease, Ethan fills any room with momentum. His confidence and charisma make him easy to trust—perhaps too easy. In the closed environment of deep space, even the brightest presence can cast a long shadow.

## DEATH

### Pre-Death Blurb

Ethan spent the afternoon prepping dinner in the galley, upbeat as always, joking and tossing around kitchen banter while throwing pizza dough with the finesse of his frisbee throws. As the evening approached and the crew gathered for the meal, Ethan never appeared. Eventually, someone went to check, and found him collapsed behind the food prep station, apron still tied, the meal half-cooked. Though the scene appears natural at first, a thin red mark on his neck suggests otherwise. The liveliness that had filled every corner of the ship now echoes as silence.

### Post-Death Blurb

Ethan's energy filled every room—his passion, his relentless optimism. With the fire of his soul and the fire on his stove put out for good, we must work together to put an end to this treachery.

## INTERVIEW RESPONSES

### [Alex](Alex.md#death):

> Alex liked to work late in the nav room, and I’d sometimes stop by after a workout to chat or grab some water. I must’ve left my sweatband on his chair without thinking. We talked about the console acting up—which mostly went over my head anyways—but I didn’t touch anything.

> So my sweatband was there? I use that chair all the time after training. Doesn’t mean I had anything to do with what happened to Alex. People leave stuff around—don’t make it more than it is.

### [Cade](Cade.md#death):

> Yep, that’s my phone. Cade and I were trading playlists while he practiced, so I left it there by accident. I was only in the rec room for a few minutes before heading to the galley. You all know how often I leave my phone laying around.

> My phone being there doesn’t mean I did anything to Cade. We always hang out in the rec room, and I leave my stuff around all the time. Don’t start blaming me just because I forgot it.

### [Colter](Colter.md#death):

> Yeah, that’s my ground beef. I brought it to Colter because he said he wanted to try an experiment with proteins. I didn’t think twice about it—he’s always asking for weird stuff from the kitchen.

> So the beef changed color? That’s probably just Colter being Colter. He’s always mixing things together to see what happens. I just handed it over and left him to his science stuff.

### [Courtney](Courtney.md#death):

> My tortilla press? I had no idea Courtney even borrowed it. She was always up to something creative, but I didn’t know she needed anything from the kitchen. I wish I’d known—maybe I could’ve helped.

> Courtney had my press? That’s where it was, dang it. She must’ve grabbed it when I wasn’t around. She was always sneaky with her surprises, but I had nothing to do with what happened to her. Stop grilling me.

### [Jacie](Jacie.md#death):

> My cleats? I was in the bay last night grabbing some fresh veggies for dinner. I must’ve tracked in more dirt than I realized—Jacie always teased me about that. I left as soon as I got what I needed.

> So my cleats were there? I use those every time I’m in the garden. I probably left them by accident after running in for some herbs. That doesn’t mean I had anything to do with what happened to Jacie.

### [Olsen](Olsen.md#death):

> Yeah, that’s my burger. I made a couple extras last night and offered one to Olsen while he was working on his puzzle. He always liked trying my new recipes. I left before he finished eating.

> My burger being there doesn’t mean I did anything to Olsen. I cook for everyone all the time—he probably just grabbed one when he got hungry. Don’t you go around blaming me for being generous.

### [Tyler](Tyler.md#death):

> My handheld? Tyler borrowed it last night—he said he needed a break from all the diagnostics. I left it with him in the control room and went to finish up in the galley.

> So my game was there? Tyler and I swapped gear all the time. He probably just wanted to unwind after a long night of troubleshooting. I didn’t stick around.

## ACCUSATION RESPONSES

### [Alex](Alex.md#death):

> I would never hurt Alex. He’s the one who keeps us on course! I just left my sweatband behind, that’s all. I wasn’t even in the nav room when things went wrong.

> Fine, I was frustrated with Alex always double-checking my work. Maybe I got careless and bumped something while I was cooling down. If my mistake caused that discharge… I never meant for it to go that far.

### [Cade](Cade.md#death):

> I wouldn’t hurt Cade. He’s my workout buddy—we push each other to do better. I just left my phone behind, that’s all. I wasn’t even there when it happened.

> Fine, I lost my temper. Cade was teasing me about my batting form, and things got heated. I threw my phone down and shoved him. He stumbled, hit his head on the cage, and I panicked. I never meant for it to go that far.

### [Colter](Colter.md#death):

> I gave Colter the beef, I don't have beef with Colter. I had no idea what he was planning, and I definitely didn’t mess with his chemicals. I wouldn’t hurt him.

> Fine, I got annoyed with Colter always raiding my kitchen for his experiments. I put some extra spices in the beef that I knew would react badly with his chemicals. I didn’t think it would be that dangerous, but I guess I pushed it too far. I’m sorry.

### [Courtney](Courtney.md#death):

> I didn’t even know Courtney took my press. She was always planning something special for the gang, but I wasn’t involved. I would never hurt her.

> Okay, I found out later that she’d borrowed my press without asking. I got annoyed and confronted her about it, and maybe I was harsher... physically... than I should’ve been. I regret it—but I never meant for anything bad to happen.

### [Jacie](Jacie.md#death):

> I would never hurt Jacie. She’s the reason we have fresh food on this ship! I just left my cleats behind, that’s all. I wasn’t there, I don't know what happened.

> Fine, I got frustrated. I cannot fathom what she wanted with my cleats, but I walked in and they were disgusting! We are quite literally in space, and the rec room has turf. Why should my cleats get covered in actual dirt? And not just the bottoms? I smacked her upside the head with them out of frustration, and they were dirty enough that I didn't even want to take them with me so I just stormed out. I didn't even know she was dead, I just thought she deserved to hurt. Fetch.

### [Olsen](Olsen.md#death):

> I would never hurt Olsen. He’s always been one of my biggest supporters in the kitchen. I just made him a burger, that’s all. I wasn’t even around when things went wrong.

> Fine, I’ll admit it. I was frustrated that Olsen never gave me honest feedback on my food—he was always too nice. I put something extra in his burger, hoping he’d finally say something critical. I never thought it would actually hurt him. I’m sorry.

### [Tyler](Tyler.md#death):

> I would never hurt Tyler. He’s the only one who can keep this ship running! I just lent him my handheld, that’s all. I wasn’t even in the control room when it happened.

> Fine, I got impatient. Tyler was so focused on fixing that console, he barely looked up when I tried to talk to him. I left my handheld there on purpose, hoping he’d take a break, but maybe it distracted him at the wrong moment. I never meant for anything bad to happen.
