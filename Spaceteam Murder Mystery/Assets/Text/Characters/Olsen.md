# Olsen Horizon: Universal Charmer

*"Building bridges is the most important thing we’ll ever do."*

Olsen is a born educator, always seeking to share knowledge and help others grow. He is calm and encouraging, making him a steadying force among the group. On the spaceship, he often organizes debates or puzzles to keep minds sharp and spirits high. But in the cold void of space, even the brightest minds can falter, and Olsen’s unshakable faith in people might be his greatest strength—or his undoing.

## DEATH

Olsen spends most of his free time in the common area, solving puzzles, reading books, or chatting with the crew. Just a few minutes ago, he was seen working on a particularly intricate puzzle, sipping hot cocoa. But we just found him slumped over the table, the puzzle unfinished. A sediment in his cup hints at poisoning, and the peaceful scene begins to take on a sinister undertone. The apparent lack of struggle only deepens the mystery, leaving us to question what may have gone down.

## INTERVIEW RESPONSES

### [Alex](Alex.md#death):

> I was hanging out with Alex earlier while he worked. While we were sitting there and I was drinking my hot cocoa, I had an epiphany and I needed to go write it down, so I left. I guess I forgot my cocoa in my hurry.

> I’m definitely not the only one who drinks out of that mug, it wasn’t me. Alex and Colter use it too! I wasn’t there this afternoon.

### [Cade](Cade.md#death):

> I was just hanging out with Cade earlier! I’m trying to brush up on my Spanish again, so I had the dictionary with me. I guess I forgot it!

> Look, I know it seems a little weird that my book was there, but do you really think I would leave it there on purpose if I was the one that hurt Cade?

### [Colter](Colter.md#death):

> I brought some of my puzzle into his lab to work on it earlier, and I guess I left one behind. I thought I was missing a piece! But I didn’t hurt him.

> I knew someone was messing with me! The puzzle was brand new, but I could have sworn I was missing a piece or two. I guess Colter took one. I don’t know why it’s burnt, though.

### [Courtney](Courtney.md#death):

> Haha, I wondered where I put that. I don’t know why she had it though, I didn’t see her after dinner tonight.

> Books are open to everyone, you know. I was reading that yesterday, but someone else totally could have grabbed it since then. I don’t keep track.

### [Ethan](Ethan.md#death):

> Oh, I lent Ethan one of my bowls for his big dinner! He said he wanted something special for plating, so I was happy to help. I didn’t stick around in the kitchen, though; I just dropped it off and left.

> Seriously? Just because my bowl was there doesn’t mean I was involved! Ethan loved using my china for his fancy meals. I wasn’t even in the kitchen when things went wrong, so don’t start pointing fingers at me.

### [Jacie](Jacie.md#death):

> Oh, that soup was so good! I forgot I had leftovers, so I’m glad Jacie had some! It wasn’t a problem at all, so I definitely wouldn’t be upset at her for it! I didn’t see anything happen.

> Oh, that’s where that went. I don’t know why Jacie wouldn’t ask me for my leftover food, but I guess it’s not that big of a deal.

### [Tyler](Tyler.md#death):

> Oh, I wondered where that picture went! I was working on the puzzle earlier and really wished I had that!

> Tyler had it? I was looking for that picture all day. Puzzles are a lot harder if you don’t have the picture to look at while you’re putting them together. But do you really think that means I killed him? No way!

## ACCUSATION RESPONSES

### [Alex](Alex.md#death):

> Guys, guys! Just because my mug was there doesn’t mean I hurt Alex. I really didn’t. Please, trust me, I wouldn’t hurt him.

> Okay, sorry. I killed him. I was just trying to hang out with my friend and make some conversation, and he was getting frustrated with me for talking so much. I got a little salty and accidentally knocked my mug over, spilling all over the console. It sparked and shocked him, and he was gone immediately. I came back to dry it up, hoping that at least we’d still be able to stay on track… but I guess at this point that doesn’t matter for me—I’m not going anywhere. Look, it was an accident, guys. I’m sorry.

### [Cade](Cade.md#death):

> I loved Cade! Why would I hurt the guy? Whacking a guy with a bat seems a little violent for me, don’t you think?

> Hey I’m sorry I never said anything. I was reading in there earlier as he was batting away, and out of nowhere, he just fell to the floor. I guess a ball hit him in the head or something, because he had, dare I say, a honkin’ goose egg on his forehead. He fell on the bat and it snapped. You guys all know I’m a little clumsy sometimes, and it would be easy to blame this on me, so I just ran and hoped you wouldn’t find out.

### [Colter](Colter.md#death):

> It’s just a puzzle, guys! Maybe he took a piece, but it’s really not that big of a deal. I know he meant no harm. I really didn’t hurt him.

> It was me. I walked in to tell him about my missing piece, and it was right there on the counter! He wasn’t even hiding it. Instead of just taking it like I should have, I dropped it in one of his beakers just to mess up what he was doing. It reacted right away and bubbled really fast. It started smoking, and we both started coughing. I ran out, but he never did. I knew I couldn’t go back in there, so I just went to my room and sat down to process. I can’t believe he actually died.

### [Courtney](Courtney.md#death):

> I went to my room early tonight. I just wanted some sleep. She probably had the book for a good reason. I had nothing to do with her dying, guys, please.

> We all know I was reading that book. I got to the good part right before dinner yesterday, but when I came back to finish, it was gone! I have been looking for it, but when I went to ask Courtney, she had it! I tried to take it from her and she didn’t want to give it to me, so I let go and she reeled back and hit her head on the floor. She got knocked out, and I was scared. I’ve made a lot of mistakes recently and was worried you guys would be mad, so I left and hoped she wouldn’t remember when she woke up. I didn’t realize she wasn't going to wake up.

### [Ethan](Ethan.md#death):

> I would never hurt Ethan! He was always so excited to cook, and I loved seeing what he’d come up with. I let him use my bowl because he asked, that’s all. Please, you have to believe me.

> Fine, I admit it. I brought him the bowl, but I also brought something else. I was jealous of how everyone raved about his food, so I slipped something into the bowl before handing it over. I didn’t think it would actually hurt him—I just wanted to mess with the taste. I’m so sorry.

### [Jacie](Jacie.md#death):

> It’s really just some soup, guys. What’s the big deal? I didn’t do anything to Jacie, I promise.

> You know what? When I made that soup, I made a big deal about how good it tasted. I shared some with everyone, but I told you not to eat the leftovers because I wanted them. I walked in to tell Jacie good night, and she was slurping it right on down! So yeah, I was angry. She was already on the ground so I just kicked her in the head and walked out. I’m still kinda salty about it, to be honest.

### [Tyler](Tyler.md#death):

> Look, I can see why you think Tyler having my puzzle picture would make me mad, but I really didn’t kill him. Maybe he had it for a good reason! I would have just asked him for it back and I’m sure he would have given it to me!

> Tyler has taken the pictures from my puzzles almost every time I pull a new one out! He usually hides them in different places, but this time he just had it right there on the table next to him. I came in to take it back, and for some reason he had this cable plugged into his wrist. It was kind of scary, why was he plugged in? I pulled the cable out to mess with him like he messes with me, and he just collapsed. I killed him. It was my fault.
