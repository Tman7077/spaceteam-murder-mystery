# Tyler Bytewell: Spectral Tech-Head

*"Improvement is the path to progress."*

Introspective and attentive, Tyler’s mind is a web of algorithms and possibilities. He thrives on solving problems, from debugging code to outsmarting complex systems. The ship’s technology is both a playground and a challenge for him, and he’s always a step ahead in understanding its quirks. But being a step ahead can mean seeing what others miss—or hiding what others shouldn’t see. In space, every move is calculated, and Tyler’s next one might be the most critical.

## DEATH

Tyler spends long hours in the control room, fine-tuning the ship’s systems and addressing minor glitches. His meticulous nature led him to stay late last night, analyzing a persistent error on the main console. When he failed to report back this morning for breakfast, we went looking and found him slumped over the terminal, a message flashing on the screen. A faint scorch mark on the console suggests a short circuit, but an open breaker panel indicates something far more deliberate. Could this have been the result of some unfortunate troubleshooting, or was it sabotage?

## INTERVIEW RESPONSES

### [Alex](Alex.md#death):

> I gave him some of my notes earlier. The nav system has been glitching recently, so he was working there and I was slaving away in the control room. We’re on the same team, we were trying to fix the same problem!

> So, he had some of my notes? I don’t exactly hide them. Maybe he was trying to fix a software problem with the nav system and thought my notes would be helpful. They’re just notes, guys.

### [Cade](Cade.md#death):

> Yeah, I was in there playing Minecraft while he swung! We were having a great chat, and then I left to go do a few things and just left my laptop.

> We were just hanging out. He hit a ball wrong and it bounced off the wall into my laptop, cracking it. I’m really sad about it because that’s how I played Minecraft with all of you guys, but it’s so not a big enough deal for me to kill him over it! I just left the laptop there and took a break.

### [Colter](Colter.md#death):

> Colter told me that he needed to borrow some of my gadgets to take some stats on his chemicals. I let him have them, but that was a few days ago and I forgot he even had them.

> So, Colter had some of my tools? He probably just needed them for whatever test he was running. I don’t lock them up or anything, and I trust everyone here with my stuff. I don’t know what happened.

### [Courtney](Courtney.md#death):

> I admit that that’s pretty sketchy, but I really have no idea. She could have been writing so many different things, but it sure looks like me. Trust me, though, I truly don’t know.

> So, she was writing my name? That could mean a bajillion different things. She even could have been writing something else with “ty”: thank you, maybe? I had nothing to do with this.

### [Ethan](Ethan.md#death):

> Ethan asked if he could borrow one of my speakers for some kitchen music while he cooked. Kinda weird because it's so small, but it was no problem. I set it up for him, but I left before he started dinner. I didn’t touch anything else in there.

> You found my speaker in the kitchen? Sure, it’s from my kit, but I use those for all sorts of things. If it was playing static, maybe I wired it wrong, but I wasn’t even there when things went bad. Don’t blame me for a little background noise!

### [Jacie](Jacie.md#death):

> Okay, hear me out. I know that seems quite suspicious, because why in the world would a random circuit board be laying by Jacie’s dead body? The thing is, I really don’t know. Please, trust me. It doesn’t make any more sense to me than it does to you.

> Guys, you know my brain is all over the place. I have been trying to get that board to work again for days, and I must have left it out somewhere. Maybe Jacie picked it up and wanted to give it back to me, or maybe one of you guys picked it up and planted it there to sus me when you killed her!

### [Olsen](Olsen.md#death):

> I cracked a piece of my suit earlier today, so that’s probably part of it. I don’t know why it was on the floor there, though. I didn’t do anything.

> I didn’t even know my  suit cracked! I wasn’t there; someone must have planted it there to sus me. I can’t believe you guys really think I might have hurt Olsen.

## ACCUSATION RESPONSES

### [Alex](Alex.md#death):

> Guys, I told you, they’re just notes! Problems with the nav system are a software issue, which is totally my wheelhouse. Alex is super smart though, and I’m sure he just wanted to do things himself instead of asking for help. I have no idea what happened. Please believe me.

> Golly, back off a little, okay? Alex was being so stubborn about the malfunctioning nav console. He really wanted to fix it instead of asking me to, but I knew he wasn’t making any progress. I offered some of my notes so he could learn instead of just butting his head against a wall, but he denied them too. I slammed them down on the table, and it cracked open the panel, sending a shock through him because he was touching the table—I was insulated from the shock because of the paper. I was angry, but not trying to hurt him. He died trying to be helpful, and I caused it. I’m so sorry I didn’t tell you earlier.

### [Cade](Cade.md#death):

> Dude, I’m not worried about the laptop. I care much more about my best friend being dead and that we don’t know who it was. I didn’t do anything to him, I hope you believe me.

> Honestly, I’m sorry. He hit the ball wrong and totally ruined my laptop. I have a hard time controlling my emotions and I just lost it. I smashed the bat on the ground, breaking it, and pushed him. He fell, and I left. I knew I pushed him hard, but I figured he would get back up like he always does. I didn’t realize he was seriously hurt, let alone dead. I'm so sorry.

### [Colter](Colter.md#death):

> I told you, he had my tools, but that’s no biggie! I wasn’t mad at all. We had a great conversation last night, and I hadn’t seen him since. So many things could have happened in the last ten hours, I really don’t know. Please trust me.

> I really was telling the truth about the tools. I am the reason he’s dead though… I’m sorry. I went in to talk to him, and he was telling me he wanted to start making clones of us. I get the whole “science is cool” thing, but that’s a step too far. I told him no, and he just wanted my hair for my DNA! I told him he was crazy, got up, and smacked one of his vials. It spilled, and I knew it was going south fast based on the immediate smell. I got out of there fast, and shut the door. His stupid experiments are the reason he’s dead, even if I’m the one who knocked over the last one. 

### [Courtney](Courtney.md#death):

> I didn’t hurt her! I really didn’t. She’s so sweet, I have no reason to be upset at her. I was up playing Minecraft when you guys came to get me saying she was dead, and I’m just as surprised as the rest of you. You’ve got the wrong guy. I promise.

> Fine! Fine. I walked in to wish her a good night, and my name was written in big letters across the top of her page. Of course I was curious, so I walked up and asked her, and she hid it. I wanted to know, so I tried to grab the notepad from her, yanking pretty hard and sending her backward. She fell back onto her pen and it looked so painful, I couldn’t bear to watch. I grabbed my page and left. Turns out, it was all nice things anyways, so I had no reason to be upset in the first place. I feel awful. I never should have fought when she didn’t want to tell me.

### [Ethan](Ethan.md#death):

> I swear, I just set up the speaker for Ethan because he wanted some tunes while he cooked. I had no idea anything would go wrong. I wouldn’t hurt him. I've known him forever, he was my friend, and I loved him.

> Yo, chill. It probably was me, but not even on purpose. I was rushing and didn’t double-check the wiring on that stupid thing. When Ethan plugged it in, it must have shorted something out. I didn’t mean for it to happen, but my mistake caused the whole thing. I’m sorry.

### [Jacie](Jacie.md#death):

> I really haven’t been sleeping well over the last couple of nights, so I went to bed earlier than most of you last night. I know that puts me alone so it’s no real alibi, but you’ve got to believe me. I really liked Jacie, she didn’t deserve to die.

> Okay, you know what? You got me. After our evening check-in, Jacie went to tend to the garden like she always does. I knew she was going to be in there alone for a minute, so I went in. She’s been refusing to talk to some of us, and has seemed upset recently, so I just wanted to check up on her and express my concern. She really didn’t like that, and started going off on me. I was just trying to help and she was being rude about it, so I got mad. I chucked the little board right into the stream of water she was using to water the plants, and it sparked big time. It shocked her, apparently to death. I didn’t want to touch that thing so I just left it, knowing you guys would catch me. I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have gotten angry.

### [Olsen](Olsen.md#death):

> Guys, I was walking down the hall earlier and the ride got a little bumpy. I stumbled into the wall and part of my shoulder piece cracked. It probably just fell off and got jostled down the hall into the common room with the turbulence. I really didn’t hurt Olsen.

> Okay, whatever! Yeah, I bonked Olsen over the head. He was making fun of me for always being in the control room instead of talking to you all. I know I’m not always around, and I wish I was, so I got a little salty. Maybe a little more than just a little salty. I pushed him, and he pushed me back. We got in a little tussle and went to the ground. I landed on top of him and something snapped. I knew he was gone, so I just ran. Look, I shouldn’t have gotten mad, and I didn’t mean to kill him, I was just angry and in the heat of the moment things turned south quickly.
