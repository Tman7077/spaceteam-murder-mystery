## Story Bits & Flavor Text

### Intro

The year is 2147. Earth is no longer the only home of humanity, but it’s a home that’s straining under the weight of its population. The pioneers among the stars have established fledgling colonies on Mars and beyond, but with each leap into the cosmos, new challenges arise. It’s a time of bold exploration and fragile hope—and the group of seven aboard the Ardent Dawn is no exception.

The Ardent Dawn is humanity’s first vessel sent to establish a sustainable homestead on Novara Prime, a distant exoplanet believed to have Earth-like conditions. Each member of our crew was carefully chosen for their unique skills and compatibility—we have trained together for months, forming bonds that seem unbreakable. But in the unyielding isolation of space, bonds can fray, and trust can erode.

The launch of the Ardent Dawn is a spectacle unlike any before it. The towering spacecraft stands against the backdrop of a crimson sunrise, gleaming with the promise of a new beginning. Aboard, we feel the gravity of our mission—both figuratively and literally—as the countdown begins. The weightlessness of orbit brings exhilaration, but as the ship turns toward the vast unknown, a somber silence falls over us. Our journey to Novara Prime begins.

### First Murder Intro

The Ardent Dawn is equipped with cutting-edge technology, geoponic systems, and enough supplies for a three-year mission. Spirits are high as we set off, the first few days filled with excitement and routine tasks. But the journey takes an unexpected turn when a minor systems error sends us off-course. We brush it off at first, but as the days pass, tensions begin to bubble beneath the surface—and as the Ardent Dawn drifts farther from its intended path, one thing becomes clear: not all dangers come from the void outside.
