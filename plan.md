## Story Bits & Flavor Text

### Intro

The year is 2147. Earth is no longer the only home of humanity, but it’s a home that’s straining under the weight of its population. The pioneers among the stars have established fledgling colonies on Mars and beyond, but with each leap into the cosmos, new challenges arise. It’s a time of bold exploration and fragile hope—and the group of seven aboard the Ardent Dawn is no exception.

The Ardent Dawn is humanity’s first vessel sent to establish a sustainable homestead on Novara Prime, a distant exoplanet believed to have Earth-like conditions. Each member of our crew was carefully chosen for their unique skills and compatibility—we have trained together for months, forming bonds that seem unbreakable. But in the unyielding isolation of space, bonds can fray, and trust can erode.

The launch of the Ardent Dawn is a spectacle unlike any before it. The towering spacecraft stands against the backdrop of a crimson sunrise, gleaming with the promise of a new beginning. Aboard, we feel the gravity of our mission—both figuratively and literally—as the countdown begins. The weightlessness of orbit brings exhilaration, but as the ship turns toward the vast unknown, a somber silence falls over us. Our journey to Novara Prime begins.

### First Murder Intro

The Ardent Dawn is equipped with cutting-edge technology, geoponic systems, and enough supplies for a three-year mission. Spirits are high as we set off, the first few days filled with excitement and routine tasks. But the journey takes an unexpected turn when a minor systems error sends us off-course. We brush it off at first, but as the days pass, tensions begin to bubble beneath the surface—and as the Ardent Dawn drifts farther from its intended path, one thing becomes clear: not all dangers come from the void outside.

## Alex Blackhole: Interstellar Captain

*"The human body is a puzzle—every joint, every bone, every nerve has its place."*

Alex has a sharp mind and a sharper focus, known for his uncanny ability to identify and alleviate physical discomfort. He’s always ready to crack a joke—or a spine—but beneath his calm demeanor lies a meticulous curiosity. His fascination with anatomy borders on the obsessive, making his expertise both reassuring and, perhaps, unsettling. On the spaceship, his steady hands and precise knowledge are invaluable, but in the quiet vastness of space, precision can be a double-edged sword.

### DEATH

Alex was conducting a routine inspection of the ship’s navigation systems to investigate minor anomalies. While examining the console, a muffled noise echoed, and the lights flickered—but the crew passed it off as turbulence. Just now, he failed to arrive at the evening check-in, so we searched and found him slumped near the navigation console. A faint burn mark on his palm suggests an electrical discharge, but the scene feels too deliberate to be a simple accident.

### CLUES & HINTS

- A utility knife with a faint trace of dried blood, often carried by Alex. 
- A charcoal pencil broken in half, something Cade was seen borrowing earlier. 
- A notebook with partially erased notes about system diagnostics, in Colter's handwriting. 
- A stray screwdriver left near the console, matching Courtney's usual tools.
- 
- A white wristband that matches Jacie's sterile suit. 
- A mug of hot cocoa sitting on the console, the same mug Olsen often drinks out of. 
- A cryptic note tucked into the console’s edge, containing coding symbols Tyler would recognize. 

### INTERVIEW RESPONSES

#### Cade:

> Cade borrows my watch sometimes when he’s batting, just to keep track of how many calories he’s burning. He asked for it after I stopped my run this morning.

> Hey, sometimes he takes my watch to track his stuff when he needs to blow off some steam. I’m sure that’s all it was. Stinks that it’s cracked, though.

#### Colter:

> Colter recently tore one of his gloves, so he asked to borrow mine. I gave it to him a few days ago, and that’s the last I saw it. It looks like he just made a mistake and burned it, but I wasn’t involved at all.

> So, he had my glove? He probably burnt one of his and just used mine so he wasn’t bare-handing the chemicals. You know how his stuff gets a little sketchy sometimes.

#### Courtney:

> Yep, that’s my pen. Maybe hers ran out of ink, I’m really not sure. It’s just a pen, though.

> Why would it be my pen? She’s got the same one, I’m sure it’s hers. She was drawing, so having a pen makes a lot of sense...

#### Ethan:

> 

> 

#### Jacie:

> I was there yesterday morning helping her prune some of the plants, and left the shears with her when I had to go. She’s had them since.

> Jacie uses those too! I might do most of the pruning, but she often does some of the smaller fine trimming with them so she doesn’t have to make me do it. She’s nice like that.

#### Olsen:

> Yeah, I was just in here! Of course the cocoa is still warm. Olsen and I were talking, but I got a ping and had to go check on the navigation quickly. It took longer than expected, so something must have happened while I was gone.

> I’m not the only one who drinks out of that mug. Someone could easily have planted it there to try to frame me. I was in the nav center.

#### Tyler:

> Yeah! Tyler and I have been passing that back and forth for the last few days. We’ve had to avoid a few asteroid fields and planetary gravity fields so we have to adjust navigation and Tyler has been helping with the tech side. So yeah, he had my notebook, but it was innocent!

> A notebook that we share? Of course he had it. There’s nothing interesting about that.

### ACCUSATION RESPONSES

#### Cade:

> This man is my roommate, my close friend, my confidant, and a guy that I admire. I would never hurt him. You can’t pin this on me. Please.

> Fine, I did it. I walked in while he was batting and asked to join. He was showing me what he always does to hit it well every time, and I tried it. He was walking up to show me one more thing, but I didn’t realize, and I swung back. He held up his arm to block the blow, but I hit him hard enough that it didn’t make a difference. He was on the floor in a second, but I thought he was just knocked out. I went to get some ice and find meds, and that’s when everyone started getting together. I wanted to help, but couldn’t believe what had just happened, so I lied earlier. It was my fault.

#### Colter:

> Dude, I did not hurt Colter! I have zero problems with him using my gloves—I’d want him to be safe, even if it meant giving up a silly pair of gloves. I promise I didn’t do anything to him. Something else happened.

> Okay, fine. He took my gloves again, after ruining who knows how many pairs of his own with his stupid chemical reactions, and I went after him. I tried to grab the gloves from him, and ended up knocking over a vial of something. It smelled awful, so I ran straight out of the room—I guess it wasn’t just an awful smell, and he never got up from it. It was an accident. The gloves aren’t that big of a deal, and now he’s dead because of me.

#### Courtney:

> You really think I could kill Courtney? No way, guys. I really didn’t do it. She went out to stargaze and I went to bed early, so I could get up for my morning run tomorrow.

> You know what, it was me. I came out to sit with her, and she closed her book as soon as I walked in. She wouldn’t tell me what she was hiding, so I took the book from her. I opened it and there were all these lovely notes about everyone in the group—except me. She’s out there alone, writing all these nice things about everyone except me, with my pen, and hiding it from me? I got angry, punched her in the gut, tore the pages out, and walked away. A stupid punch shouldn’t have killed her, though, unless I really hit the wrong thing hard. Look, I’m sorry.

#### Jacie:

> Hey, hey, hey. I wanted to get up early this morning to go on a long run, so I actually went to bed last night. I wasn’t there, I promise. I didn’t hurt Jacie.

> You know what, you’re right. I do have to come clean. Jacie has been talking trash about everyone behind their backs, and I’m tired of it. She grew a pineapple just to sneak into Courtney’s food, she spends long hours in the stupid garden growing plants and seemingly plotting to make our lives harder. I went in with the shears to prune and just stabbed her, cleaned them, and left. I shouldn’t have done it, I was just angry and we’re all stuck here. I’m sorry, everyone.

#### Ethan:

> 

> 

#### Olsen:

> I told you, I was in the navigation room! I’m pretty sure you guys want us to stay on course. I did not kill Olsen, whether or not you believe me. Please do, though, I love you guys.

> Fine. I was over Olsen always being... everywhere. I feel like no one ever really gets alone time because he’s either walking around talking to people or breathing down our necks. I know he had good intentions, but man. Sometimes I just wished he would stop talking, a lot. I sat down while he was doing the puzzle with some hot cocoa, but my mind was racing and I forgot about it. I offered to pop his back and just cracked a little extra, then went to the nav room to think. I can’t believe I killed him, but it’s too late to go back now.

#### Tyler:

> I really didn’t mess with Tyler. I needed his help—we all did. At this point, I just hope all his work helps us to get there in one piece.

> You’re right. I did kill Tyler. I wanted to help with the tech side of navigation rather than just all the math calculations I usually do, so I asked Tyler to show me the ropes. He was extremely defensive, saying he didn’t want help because he was afraid I would mess things up and cause a problem. 

## Cade Morningstar: Dwarf Planet

*"Keep your eye on the ball, and you’ll never miss."*

Cade's passion for baseball is as constant as Earth's gravity, and his love for the game has followed him into the stars. Whether he's pitching ideas or swinging into action, he’s the team player everyone can rely on. With his easy-going charm and knack for lightening the mood, Cade is the kind of person who always hits home. But even the best players sometimes strike out, and when the stakes rise, his calm exterior might just crack.

### DEATH

Cade was taking a break in the recreation room, practicing his swings in the batting cage he set up to pass time. During our evening check-in tonight, Cade never showed. We investigated and found him collapsed near the cage. A fractured bat lies nearby, its splinters scattered across the floor. It seems like it could have been an accident, but the positioning of the equipment and a faint bruise on his temple suggest otherwise. What—or who—could have caused this?

### CLUES & HINTS

- A cracked sports band, the same kind that Alex wears for his daily run. 
- A broken wooden bat, belonging to Cade.
- A small burnt patch of turf, possibly because of one of Colter's chemical reactions. 
- A boot print covered in oil, likely from Courtney’s mechanical work.
- 
- A patch of soil in the turf tracked in, similar to that in Jacie's geoponics pod. 
- An English-to-Spanish dictionary resting on the bench, something Olsen frequently carried. 
- A laptop Tyler frequently uses, its screen cracked, lying on the floor of the room. 

### INTERVIEW RESPONSES

#### Alex:

> You’re right, I borrowed the pencil from Alex. I gave it back earlier, in one piece, because he needed it to jot some nav notes down. I was in the batting cages most of the afternoon, too, so I’ve got nothing.

> Yeah, I borrowed the pencil, so what? That was hours ago, and I gave it back.

#### Colter:

> Sometimes when I hang out with Colter, his reactions make my eyes water a little, so I leave my helmet in there to protect my eyes. We’re not really using them right now anyways, in the middle of nowhere in space.

> Colter’s dumb experiments stink up the whole room sometimes, so it’s hard to sit in there without a mask on. I just use my helmet so I can sit in there without being poisoned.

#### Courtney:

> My hat, with Courtney? I’ve got nothing, that makes no sense to me.

> You really think that if I killed Courtney, I would leave my hat behind just to rat myself out? I’m not that big of a bozo. I don’t know why she had my hat.

#### Ethan:

> 

> 

#### Jacie:

> I really don’t know what that wood is from. I know we don’t have a lot that’s wooden on this ship, but I promise I didn’t do anything.

> Just because you have what looks like pieces of wood means that I killed Jacie? There are other wooden things on this ship, and you don’t even know that’s what it is. I would never hurt her, you idiots.

#### Olsen:

> Okay, throwing a puzzle piece across the room to mess with him is definitely something I would do, but killing him? No way. I did nothing to him.

> A puzzle piece is laying on the other side of the room and you think it’s me? You’re making things up. There are a million reasons why it could be over there, and maybe two of them are because I’m a “prankster.” That’s such a weak argument, bozos. Try again.

#### Tyler:

> Yeah! I was telling Tyler about Madden earlier, so I was in there on the PS5 with him last night. It was late and we were tired so I just left the stuff in there. Totally innocent.

> I play in there all the time, guys! You know it’s a nice place to relax with all the big screens on the wall. He stayed after we were done last night to wrap up a few things and I went to bed. It wasn’t me.

### ACCUSATION RESPONSES

#### Alex:

> I didn’t kill Alex! I told you, I gave his pencil back, and didn’t see him all afternoon! You’re making a mistake.

> Fine. I admit it. He was ticking me off, so when he asked for the pencil back, I jammed it into the console, and it sparked. It burnt his hand and shocked him pretty bad, so I freaked out and ran. I went right back to the cages to blow off steam and figure out what to do. You found him before I had the courage to say anything.

#### Colter:

> Just because I don’t like Colter’s stupid chemicals doesn’t mean I didn’t like him. I never hurt the guy.

> Honestly I was just so over his stupid chemistry “projects.” How much can you do with a few bottles of random stuff on a spaceship? Probably nothing important. They stink, they burn my eyes, and he’s always messing with those instead of hanging out with us. I just wanted him to stop, so I took off my helmet to talk to him face-to-face, and knocked over a vial of whatever garbage he was brewing up. It started smoking and we both started coughing. I made it out of the room, but he didn’t. I passed out in the hallway, but he never woke back up since he was so close to it. Dumb reaction anyways, the bozo got what he deserved.

#### Courtney:

> I told you, my hat was there but I wasn’t. I did not kill Courtney, bro.

> Alright, whatever. She had my favorite Rockies hat—who knows why—and she got her stupid engine oil all over it! I mean, what gives? I came into the room and saw it, took it back, and pushed her. She hit her head pretty hard on the floor, but I was angry so I just walked out. I love the hat, but I shouldn’t have hurt her over it.

#### Ethan:

> 

> 

#### Jacie:

> Maybe it’s wood from one of my broken bats, and maybe it isn’t! Please, trust me, I really don’t know what it is or how it got there. I definitely did not kill Jacie.

> Fine! I killed her. She has been getting on my nerves a lot recently, and she won’t even talk to me because she spends all her time tending to the stupid plants. I grabbed one of my broken bats and just deeshed her with it. Since it was already broken, I thought nothing would be different and you wouldn’t know it was me, but I guess I left splinters. Stupid.

#### Olsen:

> I already told you, I didn’t do it. Not that you believe me anyways.

> You know what? Whatever. I chucked his puzzle piece across the room when he wasn’t looking, just to mess with him. He turned around at just the right time and saw me, and got angry. We squared up and he pushed me, so I pushed him back! Then he got really mad, and we ended up on the floor. I put him in a headlock until he stopped moving, because at that point I was so worked up I didn’t know what else to do, and I hate being pushed around. What can I say?

#### Tyler:

> Guys! We were having a great night last night. Playing games, having a good conversation. I had no reason to kill him! It wasn’t me.

> Fine. It’s my fault. We were up late playing Madden, and he was just tanking the team. We kept losing free touchdowns because he just couldn’t play. I got frustrated and smacked him with the controller. I didn’t mean to really hurt him, just to knock some sense into him, but he was out cold. I must have hit something perfectly wrong and he was just gone. He had a couple of things to fix on the console before going to bed so I just set him there to stage the scene. I shouldn’t have gotten mad, I didn’t mean to kill him.

## Colter Helix: Shooting Star

*"The higher you climb, the farther you can see."*

Colter’s towering frame and projecting confidence make him a natural presence in any room—or ship. His resourcefulness and knack for problem-solving are matched only by his dry wit. He’s a curious blend of studious and spontaneous, often experimenting with chemicals or exploring new ideas for the sheer thrill of it. Colter’s laid-back nature draws people in, but his occasional bursts of loud enthusiasm remind everyone that there’s always more to him than meets the eye.

### DEATH

Colter spends the evenings engrossed in experiments within the laboratory, his natural curiosity leading him to tinker with complex chemical compounds. This morning, however, he was absent at breakfast. We found him slumped over his workstation, a chemical spill spreading across the counter. The acrid smell in the air suggests toxic fumes, but the arrangement of equipment hints at a more calculated setup. Was Colter’s intellect the target, or his downfall?

### CLUES & HINTS

- A white glove with faint burns, often seen worn by Alex. 
- A part of a space suit’s helmet visor, matching Cade’s suit. 
- A broken vial with a faint residue near Colter's workstation, with traces of his chemicals. 
- A keycard left on the counter, unlocking Courtney's bedroom door.
- 
- A tuft of blonde hair matching Jacie's hair color. 
- A charred puzzle piece doused in the spill, from Olsen's puzzle. 
- A set of diagnostic tools nearby, typically found in Tyler's workspace. 

### INTERVIEW RESPONSES

#### Alex:

> I gave him some of my notes earlier because he asked me to get some info from Tyler about the navigation systems. I’m not sure why part of it is erased, though.

> I was wondering where those were. I was just trying to learn from Tyler, and it looks like Alex took the notes for something—I don’t know what for.

#### Cade:

> I was hanging out with Cade this morning while he was setting up the cage, and I was messing around with some chemicals for a reaction I was planning earlier. I dropped a little on the floor, and left immediately to control it before I made more of a mess. Sorry I burned the turf, but I didn’t hurt Cade.

> I was working with some chemicals and they burned the turf, okay? I didn’t think it was that big of a deal, but that’s got nothing to do with a literal dead man on the floor.

#### Courtney:

> Courtney’s been hanging out in my lab with me a little more recently, and it’s totally possible a little of something I was working on spilled on her book. Pretty innocent, if you ask me.

> Honestly, my experiments get a little messy sometimes and they can get places that I don’t even understand. I couldn’t tell you what that was from if I wanted to.

#### Ethan:

> 

> 

#### Jacie:

> I knew I lost a glove somewhere! I can’t remember how it got into Jacie’s garden, but I promise that doesn’t mean I hurt her.

> So my glove was in a pile of dirt. I see how that’s sus, but I honestly leave them places I don’t even remember, so it was just an accident. I didn’t kill Jacie.

#### Olsen:

> I brought Olsen his mug of, well, Olsen earlier. I must have had some random chemical on my hands, though; it’s kind of crazy that my handprint is still there from hours ago.

> You’re gonna look at a faint handprint on a mug and say it’s me? That’s crazy. My hands are big but not that different from anyone else’s! You can’t just pin this on me because I have hands—you all do too!

#### Tyler:

> Ha! I wondered where that went. I’m not sure how it ended up with Tyler or what he might have been doing with it. It’s just some chemical formulas, and they probably don’t mean anything to him.

> So he found one of my random notes. I have no idea what he was up to, and I didn’t even know he could understand it! That doesn’t mean I somehow killed him over it.

### ACCUSATION RESPONSES

#### Alex:

> Guys! Seriously! I didn’t hurt Alex. He just needed my notes, that’s all! Please, don’t blame me; I just want to figure this out like all of you do.

> Okay, okay. Alex has been messing with my notes recently, and I really don’t know why. I’ve approached him about it and he’s denied it again and again. I caught him erasing them in the nav room today, and I lost it. I just wanted to throw off his plans, and mess with him like he has been messing with me, but when I hit the console, it sparked and he was out. I couldn’t wake him up. I never wanted to hurt him.

#### Cade:

> Guys, the chemical thing was an accident, and it was many hours ago. I think with how many people were in and out of that room today, you would have noticed if Cade was dead on the floor! I didn’t do anything to him.

> Okay, okay. Cade’s incessant batting at all hours was getting on my nerves. I took some chemicals into the rec room with me, and asked Cade to help me out. I lied, and it was actually a brew meant to make him feel sick so I’d have some peace and quiet for a while. I didn’t mean for it to be this strong. He quickly got disoriented and fell, breaking the bat and probably his ribs. I’m so sorry. I just wanted a break from the bat noises all day.

#### Courtney:

> Sometimes I make a mess and can’t always clean it up, but that could have been from today or from a week ago! It’s just a stain on a paper, it doesn’t mean I killed Courtney. I had no reason to!

> The stained paper really didn’t have anything to do with it, but I do have to come clean. Courtney has been really distant recently, not talking to us or hanging out as much. Of course, I respect her space, but I also wanted her to come back! I went in to talk to her, and she started telling me about how she was having a hard time living with all of us on the spaceship, so she had to start writing down nice things about us to force herself to believe them. She told me about the things I do that annoy her and I just got mad. I shoved her to the ground and she smacked her head. I feel terrible, but she didn’t want to be here anyways, so maybe it’s good for all of us.

#### Ethan:

> 

> 

#### Jacie:

> Guys, we all know I make messes sometimes. I spill chemicals during turbulence, I leave my stains places I don’t even realize. I promise that however my glove got there was completely innocent, and I didn’t do anything to Jacie.

> Right! Right. It was me. Some of the stuff she was growing for us tasted awful and she just kept making us eat them. I thought she would already be in bed, so I whipped up a chemical that would make the plants slowly die and snuck into her garden. To my surprise, she was sitting there on the ground, tending to the pineapple plants. She caught me red handed, so I just threw the brew at her and the plant. It burned her and singed the pineapple leaf into her hand. I tried to cover it all up, but I knew you would figure me out. It was a stupid mistake in a moment of fear.

#### Olsen:

> All from a handprint, huh? You guys are so lame. I didn’t do it. Really.

> Honestly, maybe it was me! There’s no mistaking that that’s my handprint. Plus, I was catalyzing a couple reactions this morning, and that could easily have caused my print to stay on the mug for a while. I guess I didn’t wash my hands thoroughly enough, and I left some residue on the mug. He probably drank out of the mug and something deadly got into his system. I never meant to hurt him.

#### Tyler:

> I really don’t know what Tyler was up to, or how he died. It looks weird that some of my notes were there, but I promise it doesn’t mean anything!

> Stop! Just let me speak. I have been developing a new chemical and I knew Tyler was on to me. The goal was to extend our lifespan with some injections, and Tyler wasn’t thrilled with the idea. He took some of my notes and I caught him in the control room trying to analyze the formula. I didn’t want him to expose me so I bashed his head into the table. It shot an error onto the screen so I hoped it would look accidental. Obviously I did something terrible, so I felt like I had to tell you. It’s fine, I deserve whatever you guys are going to do to me.

## Courtney Lunaris: Galaxy of Wonder

*"Space is a blank canvas, and I can’t wait to fill it."*

Courtney’s artistic soul finds inspiration in the boundless expanse of the cosmos. She’s the dreamer of the group, always capturing moments through her sketches or finding beauty in the cold, dark void. Her playful side, epitomized by her beloved shark onesie, masks a sharp intelligence and quiet resilience. In the vacuum of space, creativity is survival, and Courtney's ability to see what others don’t might be the key to unlocking more than just inspiration.

### DEATH

Courtney often retreats to the observation deck to find inspiration among the stars. On this particular night, she brought her notepad, eager to capture the cosmic beauty outside. When she failed to return when we were heading to bed, we discovered her lifeless body. Her notepad lies open to a half-finished drawing, but she is positioned facing away from the window—strange.

### CLUES & HINTS

- A blue and silver Interstellar pen that both Courtney and Alex own, something that Alex might know about. 
- A baseball cap with a faint smudge of grease, known to belong to Cade. 
- A smudge on the edge of the drawing pad, similar in color to one of Colter's recent experiments. 
- A brief explanation of Courtney’s plans for what turned out to be her final night.
  - *She was writing kind notes about everyone, to distribute at the upcoming celebratory dinner, to express her gratitude for everyone on the ship. She gathered something small from everyone, and went to the stars for inspiration in her writing.*
- 
- A fragment of vine from Jacie's garden stuffed in between the pages of the sketchbook. 
- A book Olsen was last seen reading. 
- A page ripped out of Courtney's notepad, with "Ty-" written right before the tear. 

### INTERVIEW RESPONSES

#### Alex:

> That is mine, but it’s there for good reason! He said there was some problem he needed to fix with the console, so he asked to borrow my screwdriver. I gave it to him, and that’s all I know.

> Yeah, it’s mine, but he wanted it to fix something with the console. I didn’t want to mess with the tech, so I just gave it to him. What if something happened, and he hit a wrong wire, and shocked himself? Do you really think I would hurt him?

#### Cade:

> I was working in the engine room earlier. I came in and talked to Cade for a sec, and must have left a smudge behind.

> When I get dirty working in the engine room, I get pretty dirty. Sometimes that means I leave a little mess behind sometimes. I haven’t been in there since this morning, though, so it couldn’t have been me.

#### Colter:

> I honestly don’t keep track of that thing. We keep all of our doors unlocked anyways, so I never think to bring it with me. I’m not sure how it got there.

> Why would I know what Colter was doing with my keycard? I never bring it with me anyways; all of our doors are just unlocked all the time.

#### Ethan:

> 

> 

#### Jacie:

> I actually didn’t even realize I wasn’t wearing that on my shoulder. It must have come off the last time I was helping her in the garden. I know it looks suspicious, but it really doesn’t mean anything.

> That darn thing has really come loose recently. Just because it was in the room doesn’t mean I stabbed her with it or anything, it was just a mistake.

#### Olsen:

> Okay, I know there’s not a lot that’s bright blue and soft on this ship, so it most likely is from my onesie. I don’t know how it got there though! That doesn’t make me sound very good, but I really didn’t want to hurt Olsen.

> Bro, a onesie is not worth killing someone for! You have to see that I know that. Maybe it is mine, maybe it’s something else entirely. But you can’t blame me just because of a dumb tuft of whatever it is.

#### Tyler:

> I loved that pencil. I don’t know why he had it or why he would have broken it, but that doesn’t mean I killed him.

> Dude that’s so lame. I loved that pencil. I can’t believe he would have broken it, that’s terrible. But I didn’t kill him for it—it’s just a pencil, even if it was my favorite one.

### ACCUSATION RESPONSES

#### Alex:

> Bro! You seriously think I would kill Alex? No way! I actually can’t believe you guys. You’re wrong, and accusing me won’t help anything! Goodness.

> Look, I’m sorry. He asked for some help with the nav console, and I brought the screwdriver to work on it. I hit something wrong, it sparked, and he was gone. I left the screwdriver behind to make it look like an accident, because I freaked out and didn’t know what else to do. I never wanted to hurt him, just to help him.

#### Cade:

> Bro, stop coming at me. I left a little oil behind, but that’s just part of working on the messy things! Be grateful, too, we kinda need those guys to keep flying in the right direction. I didn’t do anything to Cade.

> Jeez, guys, sorry. I brought a little grime with me when I came in, and he got mad about my mess. I tossed the bat at him, and he obviously wasn’t a fan, so he turned around to come at me, and tripped over the bat. He fell right on it, cracking it in half. He was rolling around groaning, but I was mad so I just closed the door and left. I didn’t realize he got hurt that bad, or I would have turned around and tried to help.

#### Colter:

> Why would I do anything to Colter? I’ve got no idea what he was doing with my card, but I didn’t even realize he had it. I did not kill him. You’ve got the wrong person.

> Hey, okay, okay. I walked in to see what he was up to, and he was using my own personal keycard as a bench scraper—I mean, what the heck? I grabbed it from him, and on my way out I poured a vial of something into a different beaker just to mess up his experiment. Then I left. Maybe it reacted wrong, maybe it blew up, or maybe he made a mistake later that afternoon and accidentally killed himself! I honestly don’t know what happened, but I hate to think it was my fault, just because I was salty about a stupid plastic card.

#### Ethan:

> 

> 

#### Jacie:

> I loved Jacie! She was so sweet and always helped out. I didn’t hurt her, guys. My medallion just came off, and I really don’t know what was up with the pineapple leaf. It’s just a plant like everything else in that room.

> Alright! I killed her. She kept sneaking more and more pineapple into every dish she made, even if it was just into my serving! I can’t stand the stuff, and you all know that. I went in to help, and just took off my medallion and stabbed her with it. It was small enough that I knew you wouldn’t catch it. I was horrified at what I had just done, so I got up and left, leaving it right on the ground. Garbage mistake. I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have overreacted, but I doubly shouldn’t have outed myself.

#### Olsen:

> Guys! Like I said, it’s probably a piece of my onesie, but who cares? I’d rather have a little bald spot or hole than a dead friend. I would not kill Olsen over something so small.

> Okay, whatever. I was walking into the room, and Olsen scooted his chair back right into me. He tore a hole right in the side of my beautiful onesie and I honestly just lost it. He said sorry, but by the way he was laughing it sure didn’t feel genuine. I pushed the chair right back under the table with him still standing in front of it, and it just bent him the wrong way and he fell to the ground just as fast as he fell off the couch last fall. I just assumed he was hurting, and I sure wasn’t in the mood to help, so I walked out and went to patch a hole in the onesie. It looks so sad now.

#### Tyler:

> I told you, it was just a pencil! I don’t know why it was there or if he was the one that broke it, but I would never kill someone just for a stupid pencil. I loved it, but not that much. Now stop blaming me for it!

> Fine! Stupid Tyler took my pencil, hid it from me, taunted me that he had it, and wouldn’t give it back. I snuck into the control room when I knew he was there, and it was right there on the table. I walked up behind him silently and smashed his head into the table so I could grab the pencil and run. That’s exactly what I did, but the impact snapped the pencil. It was too late, so I just had to run before he came to and realized what happened.. I had no idea he died until you all grabbed me this morning. I feel terrible. I’m so sorry. It’s just a dumb pencil.

## Jacie Starwalker: Astral Angel

*"Life is a homestead; it thrives when we care for it together."*

Jacie’s nurturing disposition makes her the group’s caretaker. Whether tending to plants, calming animals, or soothing tensions, she thrives on bringing life to others. On the spaceship, her green thumb extends to the small garden she’s cultivated—an oasis of calm in the sterile environment. Her desire to please often leaves her overlooked, but even the softest voices carry weight in the silence of space.

### DEATH

Jacie spent her evening tending to the geoponics bay, as she often does, ensuring the plants are thriving. She spoke frequently about the garden’s importance to the mission, but she always came to bed when she was done, so her absence this morning was alarming. We found her in the bay, face down in a pile of dirt. Such a large pile of dirt outside of the planters was a mess Jacie would never make, so how—and why—did this happen?

### CLUES & HINTS

- A set of pruning shears left open nearby, commonly used by Alex. 
- A small patch of soil with small splinters of wood, possibly from a bat Cade brought. 
- A glove with faint chemical residue, often used by Colter. 
- A dragon medallion, the same one Courtney typically wears on her shoulder.
- 
- A faint trace of blood on a pineapple crown leaf clutched in Jacie's hand. 
- A half-eaten container of some chicken soup Olsen made earlier. 
- A small circuit board fragment from Tyler’s toolkit, found near the watering system. 

### INTERVIEW RESPONSES

#### Alex:

> I was wondering where that was! I thought I lost it in the dirt somewhere, and I was going to go digging for it tomorrow. I have no idea why Alex had it.

> I have no idea why Alex had my wristband. I always wear it when I’m working in the bay, but he could have taken it any other time.

#### Cade:

> Honestly, I got done with a long morning of tending to the garden, and I just went to decompress a little in the rec room with Cade. I took off my shoes and dumped some of the dirt out, and just didn’t feel like cleaning it up.

> I was a little frustrated with the plants this morning, so when I went to talk to Cade, I didn’t even realize I hadn’t cleaned myself up. I was all dirty and brought that into the room with me. Only after I left did I realize I was a mess, so I went to shower. That’s the last time I was with him, a couple hours ago.

#### Colter:

> I’m not exactly sure what he was up to, but honestly I think he might have been trying to make clones. He asked me for some hair, which I thought was crazy, but I figured there was no way he would make any progress, so I just gave him some and went on my way. That’s all I know.

> I honestly think he was going a little crazy, working on clones or something. He wanted my hair, which is insane, but he said he had some of Alex’s and Courtney’s already, plus I didn’t think it would actually go anywhere, so I gave him a few and walked away. I can’t believe he’s dead.

#### Courtney:

> It’s just a plant, right? One leaf isn’t that big of a deal, and I don’t know why she had it.

> So, a leaf in her book? She could have yanked it off a plant whenever, that says nothing about my involvement. I wasn’t there.

#### Ethan:

> 

> 

#### Olsen:

> I try not to make messes, guys. Sorry I tracked some dirt in, but that could have been from early this morning or from two hours ago. I’ve got no idea. I didn’t do anything to Olsen.

> So I can’t walk around? When I’m all up in the dirt, I get a little messy! That doesn’t mean I killed Olsen, so get off my back.

#### Tyler:

> A little pineapple juice? Just because I’m growing a pineapple does not mean that a little juice makes it my fault. I wasn’t with him last night.

> Anyone could have poured some juice on the console! I’m sure that would have been dangerous, and I’m not that risky. I wasn’t there, guys. Leave me alone about it.

### ACCUSATION RESPONSES

#### Alex:

> I have no reason to hurt Alex! I really don’t know why Alex had my band, but that doesn’t mean I’m mad about it! It’s just a fancy bracelet.

> You’re right, I’m sorry. I walked in to check on his navigation progress, and he was doing something with my band. It’s pretty finicky and I need it to stay safe from some of the plants, so I didn’t want him to mess with it. I grabbed it, but didn’t realize it was hooked up to the computer. I pulled it too fast and it broke the cable. It made a huge spark, and burned him. He clutched his hand, and then stopped moving. I didn’t know what to do, so I put the band back and ran. I’m sorry.

#### Cade:

> This man is literally my boyfriend. Why would I kill him? I did not!

> I never meant to hurt him. Working with the plants this morning messed me up a little, and I was sneezing a lot. When I walked into the rec room to talk to Cade, I sneezed before I even said hello, and it startled him. He turned around, but the pitching machine was still on. A ball came flying and hit him right in the head, and he fell onto the bat. I sat with him for a while and cried, because I knew he wasn’t getting back up. He was the best of us, I can’t believe he’s gone. And it’s all my fault.

#### Colter:

> Hey, I might not want two of me walking around, but that does not mean I killed Colter to stop him. I left him alone after that whole encounter because I thought it was weird, and I hadn’t seen him since. I didn’t do anything.

> Okay, but do you want two of you on this spaceship? I don’t! He stopped me as I was walking away and asked me for my hair. Do you know how weird that is? When I said it was crazy, he just reached out and plucked a few from my head. I pushed him away and ran, and I heard a crash as I was getting out the door. Something must have spilled and caused something terrible to happen. Too bad he didn’t clone himself first; then there would still be one of him.

#### Courtney:

> Sometimes Courtney would come in and help me with the plants. She had every reason to have a little piece of the vine, as odd as it may be. It’s totally not a problem, so I had no reason to be upset at her! You have to believe me. I loved her, I didn’t kill her.

> Maybe, I did kill her. Maybe, for the last few weeks, she’s come in to help me with the plants, but instead cuts pieces off and takes them to wherever she takes them. I don’t know why she’s been killing my poor plants, the ones that are literally providing us food throughout this journey, but it got on my nerves. I walked in and she had a piece in her hands! She looked like she was just admiring her mischief and I got angry. I kicked her, and she fell over and knocked her head into the ground. Maybe, she got what she deserved, if she was going to kill the plants that are keeping us alive.

#### Ethan:

> 

> 

#### Olsen:

> So you think I’ll try not to make messes with a little dirt, but you expect me to make a mess with a literal dead person? That’s absurd. It wasn’t me, guys.

> You’re right. I did it. Olsen came running into the garden and told me something was wrong and I needed to come right away. Of course, I  got up and ran with him, but the huge problem? He was missing a piece of the puzzle. He had me so worried that something terrible was happening, but it was just a puzzle. I was angry so I shoved the puzzle onto the floor, but he got really mad at that and came towards me. I still had my trowel so I hit him in the head with it and he just dropped. I didn’t even think about the footprints I was leaving behind. It didn’t have to end this way.

#### Tyler:

> Guys I really don’t know what’s up with the pineapple juice. I didn’t kill Tyler and I wish you believed me. I grow these plants to help us all, I don’t want to hurt anyone.

> You know what, fine. Maybe I did kill him. Cade kept staying up with Tyler playing games until super late, which meant he never wanted to wake up in the mornings when I was ready to start the day. I knew he’d be up again last night, so I brought in a cup of pineapple juice and “accidentally” spilled it on his control console just to mess things up for him. Something about the juice made it a much bigger mess than I thought it would be, though. It shocked Tyler and the console started smoking and saying “error” on the screen. I didn’t mean for it to completely wreck his computer or kill him, I was just angry and trying to mess him up.

## Olsen Horizon: Universal Charmer

*"Building bridges is the most important thing we’ll ever do."*

Olsen is a born educator, always seeking to share knowledge and help others grow. He is calm and encouraging, making him a steadying force among the group. On the spaceship, he often organizes debates or puzzles to keep minds sharp and spirits high. But in the cold void of space, even the brightest minds can falter, and Olsen’s unshakable faith in people might be his greatest strength—or his undoing.

### DEATH

Olsen spends most of his free time in the common area, solving puzzles, reading books, or chatting with the crew. Just a few minutes ago, he was seen working on a particularly intricate puzzle, sipping hot cocoa. But we just found him slumped over the table, the puzzle unfinished. A sediment in his cup hints at poisoning, and the peaceful scene begins to take on a sinister undertone. The apparent lack of struggle only deepens the mystery, leaving us to question what may have gone down.

### CLUES & HINTS

- A second cup, placed opposite Olsen’s seat, still warm, matching Alex's preferred drinkware. 
- A puzzle piece all the way across the room, possibly linked to Cade's mischievous nature. 
- A large, faint handprint on Olsen’s cup, identified as Colter's.
- A tuft of blue fabric, matching Courtney's shark onesie.
- 
- A dirty footprint, likely tracked in from Jacie's geoponics bay. 
- A notebook page with a handwritten message, matching Olsen’s style. 
- A chipped piece of orange plastic, possibly from part of Tyler's suit. 

### INTERVIEW RESPONSES

#### Alex:

> I was hanging out with Alex earlier while he worked. While we were sitting there and I was drinking my hot cocoa, I had an epiphany and I needed to go write it down, so I left. I guess I forgot my cocoa in my hurry.

> I’m definitely not the only one who drinks out of that mug, it wasn’t me. Alex and Colter use it too! I wasn’t there this afternoon.

#### Cade:

> I was just hanging out with Cade earlier! I’m trying to brush up on my Spanish again, so I had the dictionary with me. I guess I forgot it!

> Look, I know it seems a little weird that my book was there, but do you really think I would leave it there on purpose if I was the one that hurt Cade?

#### Colter:

> I brought some of my puzzle into his lab to work on it earlier, and I guess I left one behind. I thought I was missing a piece! But I didn’t hurt him.

> I knew someone was messing with me! The puzzle was brand new, but I could have sworn I was missing a piece or two. I guess Colter took one. I don’t know why it’s burnt, though.

#### Courtney:

> Haha, I wondered where I put that. I don’t know why she had it though, I didn’t see her after dinner tonight.

> Books are open to everyone, you know. I was reading that yesterday, but someone else totally could have grabbed it since then. I don’t keep track.

#### Ethan:

> 

> 

#### Jacie:

> Oh, that soup was so good! I forgot I had leftovers, so I’m glad Jacie had some! It wasn’t a problem at all, so I definitely wouldn’t be upset at her for it! I didn’t see anything happen.

> Oh, that’s where that went. I don’t know why Jacie wouldn’t ask me for my leftover food, but I guess it’s not that big of a deal.

#### Tyler:

> Oh, I wondered where that picture went! I was working on the puzzle earlier and really wished I had that!

> Tyler had it? I was looking for that picture all day. Puzzles are a lot harder if you don’t have the picture to look at while you’re putting them together. But do you really think that means I killed him? No way!

### ACCUSATION RESPONSES

#### Alex:

> Guys, guys! Just because my mug was there doesn’t mean I hurt Alex. I really didn’t. Please, trust me, I wouldn’t hurt him.

> Okay, sorry. I killed him. I was just trying to hang out with my friend and make some conversation, and he was getting frustrated with me for talking so much. I got a little salty and accidentally knocked my mug over, spilling all over the console. It sparked and shocked him, and he was gone immediately. I came back to dry it up, hoping that at least we’d still be able to stay on track… but I guess at this point that doesn’t matter for me—I’m not going anywhere. Look, it was an accident, guys. I’m sorry.

#### Cade:

> I loved Cade! Why would I hurt the guy? Whacking a guy with a bat seems a little violent for me, don’t you think?

> Hey I’m sorry I never said anything. I was reading in there earlier as he was batting away, and out of nowhere, he just fell to the floor. I guess a ball hit him in the head or something, because he had, dare I say, a honkin’ goose egg on his forehead. He fell on the bat and it snapped. You guys all know I’m a little clumsy sometimes, and it would be easy to blame this on me, so I just ran and hoped you wouldn’t find out.

#### Colter:

> It’s just a puzzle, guys! Maybe he took a piece, but it’s really not that big of a deal. I know he meant no harm. I really didn’t hurt him.

> It was me. I walked in to tell him about my missing piece, and it was right there on the counter! He wasn’t even hiding it. Instead of just taking it like I should have, I dropped it in one of his beakers just to mess up what he was doing. It reacted right away and bubbled really fast. It started smoking, and we both started coughing. I ran out, but he never did. I knew I couldn’t go back in there, so I just went to my room and sat down to process. I can’t believe he actually died.

#### Courtney:

> I went to my room early tonight. I just wanted some sleep. She probably had the book for a good reason. I had nothing to do with her dying, guys, please.

> We all know I was reading that book. I got to the good part right before dinner yesterday, but when I came back to finish, it was gone! I have been looking for it, but when I went to ask Courtney, she had it! I tried to take it from her and she didn’t want to give it to me, so I let go and she reeled back and hit her head on the floor. She got knocked out, and I was scared. I’ve made a lot of mistakes recently and was worried you guys would be mad, so I left and hoped she wouldn’t remember when she woke up. I didn’t realize she wasn't going to wake up.

#### Ethan:

> 

> 

#### Jacie:

> It’s really just some soup, guys. What’s the big deal? I didn’t do anything to Jacie, I promise.

> You know what? When I made that soup, I made a big deal about how good it tasted. I shared some with everyone, but I told you not to eat the leftovers because I wanted them. I walked in to tell Jacie good night, and she was slurping it right on down! So yeah, I was angry. She was already on the ground so I just kicked her in the head and walked out. I’m still kinda salty about it, to be honest.

#### Tyler:

> Look, I can see why you think Tyler having my puzzle picture would make me mad, but I really didn’t kill him. Maybe he had it for a good reason! I would have just asked him for it back and I’m sure he would have given it to me!

> Tyler has taken the pictures from my puzzles almost every time I pull a new one out! He usually hides them in different places, but this time he just had it right there on the table next to him. I came in to take it back, and for some reason he had this cable plugged into his wrist. It was kind of scary, why was he plugged in? I pulled the cable out to mess with him like he messes with me, and he just collapsed. I killed him. It was my fault.

## Tyler Bytewell: Spectral Tech-Head

*"Improvement is the path to progress."*

Introspective and attentive, Tyler’s mind is a web of algorithms and possibilities. He thrives on solving problems, from debugging code to outsmarting complex systems. The ship’s technology is both a playground and a challenge for him, and he’s always a step ahead in understanding its quirks. But being a step ahead can mean seeing what others miss—or hiding what others shouldn’t see. In space, every move is calculated, and Tyler’s next one might be the most critical.

### DEATH

Tyler spends long hours in the control room, fine-tuning the ship’s systems and addressing minor glitches. His meticulous nature led him to stay late last night, analyzing a persistent error on the main console. When he failed to report back this morning for breakfast, we went looking and found him slumped over the terminal, a message flashing on the screen. A faint scorch mark on the console suggests a short circuit, but an open breaker panel indicates something far more deliberate. Could this have been the result of some unfortunate troubleshooting, or was it sabotage?

### CLUES & HINTS

- A small notepad used to note navigation and trajectory info, shared by Tyler and Alex. 
- A PS5 controller Cade often used in the control room, because of the big screens. 
- A cryptic note tucked under the keyboard, containing symbols resembling Colter's chemical formulas. 
- A charcoal pencil, like what Courtney uses for sketching, broken on top of the navigation notepad. 
- 
- A spilled bit of pineapple juice spilled on the wiring, likely from Jacie's plant. 
- A puzzle reference image left on the console, from the puzzle Olsen was last seen doing. 
- A diagnostic tablet left on the table, showing Tyler's latest analysis logs. 

### INTERVIEW RESPONSES

#### Alex:

> I gave him some of my notes earlier. The nav system has been glitching recently, so he was working there and I was slaving away in the control room. We’re on the same team, we were trying to fix the same problem!

> So, he had some of my notes? I don’t exactly hide them. Maybe he was trying to fix a software problem with the nav system and thought my notes would be helpful. They’re just notes, guys.

#### Cade:

> Yeah, I was in there playing Minecraft while he swung! We were having a great chat, and then I left to go do a few things and just left my laptop.

> We were just hanging out. He hit a ball wrong and it bounced off the wall into my laptop, cracking it. I’m really sad about it because that’s how I played Minecraft with all of you guys, but it’s so not a big enough deal for me to kill him over it! I just left the laptop there and took a break.

#### Colter:

> Colter told me that he needed to borrow some of my gadgets to take some stats on his chemicals. I let him have them, but that was a few days ago and I forgot he even had them.

> So, Colter had some of my tools? He probably just needed them for whatever test he was running. I don’t lock them up or anything, and I trust everyone here with my stuff. I don’t know what happened.

#### Courtney:

> I admit that that’s pretty sketchy, but I really have no idea. She could have been writing so many different things, but it sure looks like me. Trust me, though, I truly don’t know.

> So, she was writing my name? That could mean a bajillion different things. She even could have been writing something else with “ty”: thank you, maybe? I had nothing to do with this.

#### Ethan:

> 

> 

#### Jacie:

> Okay, hear me out. I know that seems quite suspicious, because why in the world would a random circuit board be laying by Jacie’s dead body? The thing is, I really don’t know. Please, trust me. It doesn’t make any more sense to me than it does to you.

> Guys, you know my brain is all over the place. I have been trying to get that board to work again for days, and I must have left it out somewhere. Maybe Jacie picked it up and wanted to give it back to me, or maybe one of you guys picked it up and planted it there to sus me when you killed her!

#### Olsen:

> I cracked a piece of my suit earlier today, so that’s probably part of it. I don’t know why it was on the floor there, though. I didn’t do anything.

> I didn’t even know my  suit cracked! I wasn’t there; someone must have planted it there to sus me. I can’t believe you guys really think I might have hurt Olsen.

### ACCUSATION RESPONSES

#### Alex:

> Guys, I told you, they’re just notes! Problems with the nav system are a software issue, which is totally my wheelhouse. Alex is super smart though, and I’m sure he just wanted to do things himself instead of asking for help. I have no idea what happened. Please believe me.

> Golly, back off a little, okay? Alex was being so stubborn about the malfunctioning nav console. He really wanted to fix it instead of asking me to, but I knew he wasn’t making any progress. I offered some of my notes so he could learn instead of just butting his head against a wall, but he denied them too. I slammed them down on the table, and it cracked open the panel, sending a shock through him because he was touching the table—I was insulated from the shock because of the paper. I was angry, but not trying to hurt him. He died trying to be helpful, and I caused it. I’m so sorry I didn’t tell you earlier.

#### Cade:

> Dude, I’m not worried about the laptop. I care much more about my best friend being dead and that we don’t know who it was. I didn’t do anything to him, I hope you believe me.

> Honestly, I’m sorry. He hit the ball wrong and totally ruined my laptop. I have a hard time controlling my emotions and I just lost it. I smashed the bat on the ground, breaking it, and pushed him. He fell, and I left. I knew I pushed him hard, but I figured he would get back up like he always does. I didn’t realize he was seriously hurt, let alone dead. I'm so sorry.

#### Colter:

> I told you, he had my tools, but that’s no biggie! I wasn’t mad at all. We had a great conversation last night, and I hadn’t seen him since. So many things could have happened in the last ten hours, I really don’t know. Please trust me.

> I really was telling the truth about the tools. I am the reason he’s dead though… I’m sorry. I went in to talk to him, and he was telling me he wanted to start making clones of us. I get the whole “science is cool” thing, but that’s a step too far. I told him no, and he just wanted my hair for my DNA! I told him he was crazy, got up, and smacked one of his vials. It spilled, and I knew it was going south fast based on the immediate smell. I got out of there fast, and shut the door. His stupid experiments are the reason he’s dead, even if I’m the one who knocked over the last one. 

#### Courtney:

> I didn’t hurt her! I really didn’t. She’s so sweet, I have no reason to be upset at her. I was up playing Minecraft when you guys came to get me saying she was dead, and I’m just as surprised as the rest of you. You’ve got the wrong guy. I promise.

> Fine! Fine. I walked in to wish her a good night, and my name was written in big letters across the top of her page. Of course I was curious, so I walked up and asked her, and she hid it. I wanted to know, so I tried to grab the notepad from her, yanking pretty hard and sending her backward. She fell back onto her pen and it looked so painful, I couldn’t bear to watch. I grabbed my page and left. Turns out, it was all nice things anyways, so I had no reason to be upset in the first place. I feel awful. I never should have fought when she didn’t want to tell me.

#### Ethan:

> 

> 

#### Jacie:

> I really haven’t been sleeping well over the last couple of nights, so I went to bed earlier than most of you last night. I know that puts me alone so it’s no real alibi, but you’ve got to believe me. I really liked Jacie, she didn’t deserve to die.

> Okay, you know what? You got me. After our evening check-in, Jacie went to tend to the garden like she always does. I knew she was going to be in there alone for a minute, so I went in. She’s been refusing to talk to some of us, and has seemed upset recently, so I just wanted to check up on her and express my concern. She really didn’t like that, and started going off on me. I was just trying to help and she was being rude about it, so I got mad. I chucked the little board right into the stream of water she was using to water the plants, and it sparked big time. It shocked her, apparently to death. I didn’t want to touch that thing so I just left it, knowing you guys would catch me. I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have gotten angry.

#### Olsen:

> Guys, I was walking down the hall earlier and the ride got a little bumpy. I stumbled into the wall and part of my shoulder piece cracked. It probably just fell off and got jostled down the hall into the common room with the turbulence. I really didn’t hurt Olsen.

> Okay, whatever! Yeah, I bonked Olsen over the head. He was making fun of me for always being in the control room instead of talking to you all. I know I’m not always around, and I wish I was, so I got a little salty. Maybe a little more than just a little salty. I pushed him, and he pushed me back. We got in a little tussle and went to the ground. I landed on top of him and something snapped. I knew he was gone, so I just ran. Look, I shouldn’t have gotten mad, and I didn’t mean to kill him, I was just angry and in the heat of the moment things turned south quickly.
