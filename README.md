# ðŸš€ Spaceteam Murder Mystery

Welcome aboard the *Ardent Dawn*! What starts as a peaceful journey among close friends quickly spirals into suspicion, secrets, and sabotage.
**Spaceteam Murder Mystery** is an interactive, narrative-driven experience where you piece together what went wrong.

## What Is This?

This project is a **story-based mystery game** set in space, starring eight characters navigating a crisis.
Think *Among Us* meets visual novel meets whodunit. Youâ€™ll explore crime scenes, gather clues, interview characters
(they might get mad!) and try to determine what really happened before a rampant killer strikes again.

Keep in mind, this isn't just one set story! Each game is randomized, allowing for millions of possibilities...
You'll never run out of unique games.

## Current Status

This is an ongoing project! I'm actively building the app from the ground up, and hope to include
a ton of interesting features to encourage anyone to play, and anyone who does to return.

## Who Is It For?

Fans of:
- Murder mysteries
- Interactive fiction
- Space adventures
- Games like *Among Us* or *Clue*

No prior gameplay experience is needed. Just curiosity, critical thinking, and maybe a little paranoia ðŸ˜‰

## Technical Bits (Light Version)

This project is being built with **C# and WPF** for a custom app-style experience.
Truly, it's a foray into app development at a scale I have never even approached.
While the goal is to make something easily approachable by anyone, it will most definitely be rough around the edges.

### Disclosure:

Almost all of the art (visual, aural, and otherwise) has been generated by AI.
The focus of this application (for now, at least) is not to demonstrate my artistic abilities;
as such, they are largely filler, meant to bridge the gap between a text-based adventure and
a game crafted by actual artists.

I have generated the images myself using
[FLUX.1 Dev](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev),
and the music is a combination of selections from
[StockTune](https://stocktune.com) (which also largely does AI-generated content,
and to which I do have commercial rights) and
[ACEStep v1-3.5B](https://huggingface.co/ACE-Step/ACE-Step-v1-3.5B),
both of which I have edited for my needs.

### Coming Soon

- Actual demo builds
- Better (and consistent) code documentation
- Possibly a Steam or .exe/.msix release for wider distribution

## Want to Learn More?

This project began as a follow-up to a murder mystery PowerPoint that I created for a presentation night with my friends.
VBA macros didn't satisfy my desires, so here we are! It's evolving all the time, and I'm excited.
